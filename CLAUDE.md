# Important Writing Style And Architecture Constraints

- Do NOT document non-user-facing implementation details. Focus only on information
  that is relevant to users creating games with GDevelop, not internal engine behavior.
- Do NOT list all actions/conditions in a list or table: the reference documentations are already
  automatically generated for this.
- Do not specify the default values. Don't feel forced to list all the properties of a
  behavior/object/condition/action: prefer to explain use cases, examples and how it's useful
  for the end user which will create a game with it.
- Do not explain standard default/shortcuts (the UI is supposed to make this clear already).
