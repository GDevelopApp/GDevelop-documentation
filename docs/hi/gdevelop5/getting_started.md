#शुरू करना

GDevelop is a free, open-source, and cross-platform game creation tool that anyone can use to create games *without* programming skills.

This guide explains how to get up and running with GDevelop.

## Step 1: Install GDevelop

GDevelop is available for all major operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux. To download GDevelop, visit \[gdevelop-app.com/download\](<https://gdevelop-app.com/download/>).

The installation instructions depend on the operating system.

* **Windows**: double-click the executable. This installs GDevelop, launches the app, and adds an icon to the Desktop. * **macOS**:

1. Open the DMG file.
2. Drag "GDevelop.app" into the "\~/Applications" directory.

* **Linux**:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Make the AppImage file executable by typing `chmod a+x GDevelop*.AppImage`.
3. Run it: `./GDevelop*.AppImage` (or double click on the file).

!!! note

    There's an online version of GDevelop available at \[editor.gdevelop-app.com\](<https://editor.gdevelop-app.com/>). In general though, we recommend using the desktop version.

## Step 2: Create a new project

1\. Launch GDevelop. 2. Click **Create a new project**. 3. Choose a location for the project. 4. Select one of the projects from the **Starters** tab, such as **Platformer** or **8-bit Space Shooter**, or start a game from scratch by selecting the **Empty** project.

The projects in the **Starters** tab demonstrate how to create entire games, while the projects in the **Examples** tab demonstrate how to create specific features.

## Step 3: Preview the game

If a project has at least one scene, which all of the starter projects do, a **Preview** button is available via the toolbar. This button launches a preview of the game.
