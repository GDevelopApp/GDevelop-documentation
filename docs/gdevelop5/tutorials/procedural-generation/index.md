## What is Procedural Generation

Procedural generation is way for the computer to create parts of the game for you, typically this means textures or terrain. A good example of procedural generation is Minecraft where every world created is unique, but made up of the same elements; dirt, stone, water, etc.

!!! note

    Understanding procedural generation explains why things happen and implementing procedural generation explains how it happens
