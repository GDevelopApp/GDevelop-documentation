# Concepts

This page provides an overview of GDevelop's essential concepts, with links to find more information.

## Projects

In GDevelop, a *project* is a container for the game's assets and logic. To create a game in GDevelop, the first thing you need to do is create a project. You can think of a project as being synonymous with a game.

To learn more about projects, refer to [Project Manager](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager).

## Scenes

A project/game is made up of scenes. Typically, each scene is a different screen in the game. For example, the main menu, pause menu, and each level in a game would each be different scenes.

To learn more about scenes, refer to [Scene Editor](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor).

## Objects

Everything that appears in a scene is an _object_. This includes -- but is not limited to -- the playable character, enemies, and parts of the environment.

You can create different types of objects for different purposes. For example, [Sprite](/gdevelop5/objects/sprite) objects add animated graphics to a game, while [Text](/gdevelop5/objects/text) objects add text to a game.

To learn more about objects, refer to [Objects](/gdevelop5/objects).

## Behaviors

_Behaviors_ add significant features to objects in a matter of clicks. For example, behaviors can:

* Automatically remove objects from a scene when they move outside the edges of the screen.
* Make objects move in a realistic way by following the laws of physics.
* Allow players to move an object with the arrow keys.

To learn more about behaviors, refer to [Behaviors](/gdevelop5/behaviors).

## Events

_Events_ define the logic of a game. You can use events to create cause and effect. For example, an event might detect when the player has collided with a collectible item and, as a result, increment the player's score. You can create and manage events via the [Events editor](/gdevelop5/interface/events-editor).

To learn more about events, refer to [Events](/gdevelop5/events).

## Variables

_Variables_ store temporary data, such as numbers and text. Typically, games use variables to keep track of important data points, such as the player's name, health, and score.

To learn more about variables, refer to [Variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables).
