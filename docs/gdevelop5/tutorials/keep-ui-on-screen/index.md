title: How to keep UI objects on screen?
---

When a [camera](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/layers-and-cameras/#cameras) position is changed to follow character movements. Every other object in the same [layer](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/layers-and-cameras/#layers) appears to move on the screen. This is what is expected for backgrounds but UI (User Interface) objects like life bars and menus must stay in place.

To avoid UI objects to leave the screen, they must be [moved in their own layer](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/layers-and-cameras/#moving-objects-to-a-different-layer).
