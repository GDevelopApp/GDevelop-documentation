# How to Change the Event Sheet's Action and Condition Editor Mode

GDevelop has two different modes, one mode which lists all conditions or actions in the engine, and a new mode that filters the condition or action list by a selected object. Currently the engine defaults to the new mode, but some users may find the full list easier to work with, or may be following a tutorial that doesn't use the new mode. Switching this mode is relatively simple.

!!! tip

    No matter what mode the main condition/action editor is set to, you can always access the new editor by right-clicking on the **Add condition** or **Add action** links within any event. The new editor will display in a small pop-up "modal" window.

## Changing the mode

  - Within GDevelop, click the **File** tab.
  - Click the **Preferences** menu.
  - Within the **Event Sheet** section,  click **Use the new action/condition editor**. If it is currently enabled, it will be disabled and vice versa.
  - Click **Close**. The event editor mode will now be updated.
