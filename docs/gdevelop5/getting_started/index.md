# Getting Started with GDevelop

This page explains how to start GDevelop and provides the first steps recommended for beginners.

## Step 1: Download and start GDevelop

GDevelop is available for all devices—computers (Windows, macOS, and Linux), tablets, and phones (iPad, iPhone, Android devices). To download GDevelop, visit [gdevelop.io/download](https://gdevelop.io/download/).

* **Windows**: Double-click the executable file. Click "Next" several times until the installation begins. This installs GDevelop, launches the app, and adds an icon to your Desktop.
* **macOS**: Open the DMG file and drag "GDevelop" into your "~/Applications" directory.
* **Linux (Flatpak)**: Open a terminal and follow the command line instructions at the bottom of the [GDevelop Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gdevelop.ide).
* **Linux (AppImage)**: Open a terminal. Make the AppImage file executable by typing `chmod a+x GDevelop*.AppImage` and pressing Enter. Then run it: `./GDevelop*.AppImage` (or double-click the file).
* **iOS**: Download [GDevelop from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gdevelop-game-maker/id1663675754).
* **Android**: Download [GDevelop from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gdevelop.ide).
* **Chromebooks or other devices**: Open your browser and go to [editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io). If you're on Android or a Chromebook, choose the option to add it to your home screen.

!!! warning

    Installing or using GDevelop at work, university, or anywhere with a firewall? Make sure to [unblock/allow access to all the domains used by GDevelop—see the list here](/gdevelop5/getting_started/batch-install-gdevelop-company-university).


!!! tip

    For administrators installing GDevelop on multiple machines (for a company or university, for example), the Windows installer is based on *NSIS*, so you can find online resources to use it from a script. Read this page to learn about [installing GDevelop on a network of machines](/gdevelop5/getting_started/batch-install-gdevelop-company-university). You can also create a [portable version of GDevelop by extracting it with 7zip](/gdevelop5/getting_started/windows-portable-version-gdevelop).

## Step 2: Customize a game template or create a new project

When you launch GDevelop, you can choose a game template that can be customized in a few minutes (which is great for getting a feel for game creation), open a game template in the editor, or start from scratch.
