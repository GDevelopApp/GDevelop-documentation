# Getting Started with GDevelop

GDevelop is a free, open-source, and cross-platform game creation tool that anyone can use to create games *without* programming skills.

This guide explains how to get started with GDevelop.

## Step 1: Install GDevelop

GDevelop is available for all major operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux. To download GDevelop, visit [gdevelop.io/download](https://gdevelop.io/download/).

!!! note

    If you're on a phone, tablet or can't install GDevelop on your device (Chromebooks), use the online version of GDevelop available at [editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io/). You can use it to create full games and store your projects in the Cloud.

The installation instructions depend on the operating system.

**Windows**:

  * Double-click on the executable.
  * Click on the Next button several times, until the installation begins. This installs GDevelop, launches the app, and adds an icon to the Desktop.

**macOS**:

  * Open the DMG file.
  * Drag "GDevelop.app" into the "~/Applications" directory.

**Linux (flatpak)**:

  * Open a terminal.
  * Follow the command line instructions at the bottom of the [GDevelop Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gdevelop.ide)

**Linux (AppImage)**:

  * Open a terminal.
  * Make the AppImage file executable by typing `chmod a+x GDevelop*.AppImage`.
  * Run it: `./GDevelop*.AppImage` (or double-click on the file).

**Phone, tablets, and Chromebooks**:

  * Open your browser and go to [editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io).
  * If you are on Android or a Chromebook, choose the option to "Add to Homescreen".

!!! tip

    For administrators trying to install GDevelop on several machines (with a company or a university, for example), the Windows installer is based on *NSIS*, so you can find online resources to use it from a script. Read this page to learn about [installing GDevelop on a network of machines](/gdevelop5/getting_started/batch-install-gdevelop-company-university). You can also have a [portable version of GDevelop by extracting it with 7zip](/gdevelop5/getting_started/windows-portable-version-gdevelop).

## Step 2: Create a new project

1. Launch GDevelop.
2. Either open a **Template** to use as a starting point, or click **Create a project** to start from an empty project.
3. Choose a location and name for the project, as well as the game's resolution if starting a new project.

## Step 3: Preview the game

A **Preview** button is available via the toolbar. This button launches a preview of the game in a new window.

!!! tip

    To preview your game from a mobile device, click the down arrow and select **Start Network Preview**.  Then use a browser on your mobile device to visit the address that is displayed. **Alternatively**, you can click the publish button and generate a private web link for the game through GDevelop's games hosting platform [gd.games](https://gd.games/).
