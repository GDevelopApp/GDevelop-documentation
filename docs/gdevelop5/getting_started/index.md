# Getting Started with GDevelop

This page explains how to start GDevelop and the first steps recommended for beginners.

## Step 1: Start GDevelop

GDevelop is available for all computers (Windows, macOS, and Linux), tablets and phones (iPad, iPhone, Android phones and tablets). To download GDevelop, visit [gdevelop.io/download](https://gdevelop.io/download/).

* **Windows**: double-click on the executable. Click on the Next button several times, until the installation begins. This installs GDevelop, launches the app, and adds an icon to the Desktop.
* **macOS**: open the DMG file and Drag "GDevelop" into the "~/Applications" directory.
* **Linux (flatpak)**: Open a terminal abd follow the command line instructions at the bottom of the [GDevelop Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gdevelop.ide).
* **Linux (AppImage)**: Open a terminal. Make the AppImage file executable by typing `chmod a+x GDevelop*.AppImage` then press Enter. Then, run it: `./GDevelop*.AppImage` (or double-click on the file).
* **iOS**: download [GDevelop from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gdevelop-game-maker/id1663675754).
* **Android**: download [GDevelop from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gdevelop.ide).
* **Chromebooks or other devices**: open your browser and go to [editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io). If you are on Android or a Chromebook, choose the option to "Add to Homescreen".

!!! tip

    For administrators trying to install GDevelop on several machines (with a company or a university, for example), the Windows installer is based on *NSIS*, so you can find online resources to use it from a script. Read this page to learn about [installing GDevelop on a network of machines](/gdevelop5/getting_started/batch-install-gdevelop-company-university). You can also have a [portable version of GDevelop by extracting it with 7zip](/gdevelop5/getting_started/windows-portable-version-gdevelop).

## Step 2: Customize a game template or create a new project

When launching GDevelop, you can choose a game template that can be customized in a few minutes (which is good for getting a try at game creation), open a game template in the editor or start from scratch.
