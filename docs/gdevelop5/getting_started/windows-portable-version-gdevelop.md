# Use a portable version of GDevelop on Windows

The installer you can download on [gdevelop.io/download](https://gdevelop.io/download) for Windows is an executable created with "NSIS".

If you want to have a portable version of GDevelop (that you can paste in any folder and run), just extract the .exe file you downloaded with [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

If you're an administrator of a network, you might also be interested by this page about [installing GDevelop on a large fleet of Windows machines](/gdevelop5/getting_started/batch-install-gdevelop-company-university). You can also decide to use the full online version available at [editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io).
