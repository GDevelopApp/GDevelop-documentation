# Open a game made with GDevelop 4

GDevelop 5 is based on the same engine as GDevelop 4 and games are compatible. You must still ensure that:

  * Your GDevelop 4 game is based on the **HTML5 platform**. Native games are not supported for now by GDevelop 5.
  * A **few extensions/features** are still not supported in GDevelop 5.

To open your game with GDevelop 5, open it with GDevelop 4 and save it in a json file:

  * In the ribbon menu, choose **File > Save as...**.
  * Choose a folder, then enter a filename finishing by **.json**. For example:

![](/gdevelop5/getting_started/screenshot_2017-12-25_23.14.09.png)

Click on Save. You can now open this file with GDevelop 5.

Make sure to **check that everything is working** before continuing to create your game with GDevelop 5.
