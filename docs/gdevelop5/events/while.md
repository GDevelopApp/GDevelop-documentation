# While events

While events are a special kind of [event](/gdevelop5/events): as long as the *"While` conditions* are true, the event is repeated without interruption (the next events are **not executed** and the screen is **not** refreshed).

While events are usually not needed, but these events can be used to repeat actions as long as a given set of conditions is true. The While event is useful for algorithms that you may want to create in your game.
