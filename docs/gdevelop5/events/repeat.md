# Repeat events

Repeat events work like standard [events](/gdevelop5/events), but they are repeated multiple times in a row before continuing to the next event in the list. The events that follow are not executed until the number of repetitions has been reached.

Note that this count can be an expression. That means that you can make the number of repetitions vary according to something that the player does. For example, you can create a different number of enemies according to an object's life count, position, etc. You can also create a random number of objects on the scene (see the example below).
