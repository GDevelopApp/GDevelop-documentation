# Return values of functions

In the case of functions, you need to return a value based on the type of expressions (a number or string)/conditions (true or false) you want to make.

## Return value for condition

For a condition, you need to set when the condition returns true or false. For this, you can set the condition to true or false using the "Set condition return value" action.

## Return value for numeric expression

If you make a numerical expression using functions, it should return a value in the form of a number. You can return a number using the "Set number return value" action. In "The number to be returned" field, you can enter the desired number or the expression whose value will be returned with the condition.

## Return value for string expression

If you make a string expression using functions, it should return a value in the form of a string. You can return a string using the "Set text return value" action. In "The text to be returned" field, you can either enter the desired text surrounded by quotes, or the string expression whose value will be returned with the condition.
