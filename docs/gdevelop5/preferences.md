# Preferences

You can change how GDevelop looks and behaves to suit your preferences.

## Opening Preferences

**On the web app**: Projects manager → Preferences

**On the desktop version**: File → Preferences

## Changing the theme

Themes let you customize the look of the interface.

**UI theme** changes the application's appearance.

**Code editor theme** changes how the JavaScript code block looks.

There are multiple themes to choose from, and you can even create your own. See [how you can make one](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README-themes.md).

## Changing backdrop click behavior

This setting controls what happens when the backdrop (the faded area outside a window) is clicked.

If **No changes** is selected, clicking the backdrop won't close the window.

If **Cancel changes** is selected, any edits in the current window are **abandoned** (only available in some windows).

If **Apply changes** (default) is selected, any edits in the current window are **applied** (only available in some windows).


## Hints and explanations

GDevelop displays hints and explanations for certain features. You can turn them off if you prefer.

Example of a hint/explanation:

## Keyboard shortcuts

There is a separate page discussing keyboard shortcuts and the command palette.

See [command palette and shortcuts](/gdevelop5/interface/command-palette-and-shortcuts).

## Changing language

You can choose what language the interface should use.

Go to the **Start Page**:

![](/gdevelop5/home-page-language-select.png)

Choose from the available languages in the list.

Some languages might not be fully supported—you can see an estimate of the translation progress.

You can help translate GDevelop into your language and report any mistakes. Your help is greatly appreciated.
