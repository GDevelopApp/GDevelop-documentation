# Preferences

You can change how GDevelop looks and behaves to suit your preferences.

## Opening Preferences

**On the web app**: Projects manager → Preferences

**On the desktop version**: File → Preferences

The preferences window will look like this:

## Changing the theme

Themes allow you to change how the interface looks.

**UI theme** changes the UI's appearance

**Code editor theme** changes the appearance of the code editor in the JavaScript code block

There are multiple themes you can choose from. You can also create your own themes! See [how you can make one](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README-themes.md).

## Changing backdrop click behavior

This allows you to choose what will happen when the backdrop (the faded part outside a window) is clicked.

If **No changes** is selected, clicking the backdrop won't close the window.

If **Cancel changes** is selected, the changes made in the current window will be **abandoned** (only happens in some windows).

If **Apply changes** (default) is selected, the changes made in the current window will be **applied** (only happens in some windows).


## Hints and explanations

GDevelop shows some hints/explanations for certain features in the UI. You can toggle them off if you don't want them to be shown.

Example of a hint/explanation:

## Keyboard shortcuts

There is a separate page discussing keyboard shortcuts and the command palette.

See [command palette and shortcuts](/gdevelop5/interface/command-palette-and-shortcuts).

## Changing language

You can choose what language the interface should use.

Go to the **Start Page**:

![](/gdevelop5/home-page-language-select.png)

You can choose from the available languages in the list.

Some languages might not be fully supported—you can see an estimate of how much has been translated.

You can help translate GDevelop to your language and report any mistakes. It would be much appreciated.
