GDevelop requires an internet connection to access services such as: exporting a game, games examples, tutorials, cloud saves etc. See below for a list of domains that need to be whitelisted for the services to work fully.

# Domains to be allowed for GDevelop app & services to function correctly.

If you can, allow the main domain ``*.gdevelop.io``. Then other domains can be called such as:

    *.gdevelop.io
    *.liluo.io
    *.gd.games
    *.gdevelop-app.com
    *.compilgames.net
    *.github.com
    *.cloudfront.net
    *.googleapis.com
    gdevelop-services.firebaseapp.com
    gdevelop-services.firebaseio.com
