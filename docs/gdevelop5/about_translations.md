# About translations

Translations are written by volunteers. If you're a native speaker or fluent in another language, you are welcome to create an account on Github then submit a Pull Request on this repository to edit or create the pages related to your language. You will find out the [other languages in this folder](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-documentation/tree/main/docs).

In case of doubts or questions, [open an issue here](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-documentation/issues), a staff member will get back to you.
