# About translations

Keeping translations up to date with the documentation is challenging, so translated files are not committed to the repository.
Instead, we rely on Google Translate to provide up-to-date translations of the documentation.

If you have any questions, [open an issue here](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-documentation/issues) and a staff member will get back to you.
