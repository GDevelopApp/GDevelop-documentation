# About translations

Translations are hard to keep up to date with constant changes in the documentation. So they are not committed to the repository.
Instead, we rely on Google Translate to provide up to date translations for the documentation.

In case of doubts or questions, [open an issue here](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-documentation/issues), a staff member will get back to you.
