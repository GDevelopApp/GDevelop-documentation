When the action is used, the object(s) will select a random nearby location and begin moving towards it (using the Pathfinding behavior). 

If desired, choose a direction and how closely you want the object to follow it.  This can be used to make objects chase (or run away from) the player, or to make objects cross the screen using a meandering path.

If you keep using the action, once the object reaches a destination, it will select a new random location and begin moving towards it.

If you want to modify the speed of the object, edit the Pathfinding behavior of the object.

## Actions

Make object travel to a random position around the object current position. The movement is initiated only when the object is not moving already (its Pathfinding behavior speed is 0).  Move towards a specified angle, if desired.
