How to use:

- Run the "Generate Dungeon Cave" or "Generate Dungeon with Rooms" action at the beginning of a scene.

Tips:

- Keep the amount of space used by room objects to less than ~25% of the total map.  If you add too many rooms, they will not be placed correctly and might collide with other rooms.
- Try using top-down controls combined with physics behavior (with no gravity) on the player and wall objects
- Use external layouts to place pre-designed rooms on randomly created room objects
- Use "Delete Unused Terrain" option to reduce resources used
- Use "RoomID(object)" expression to determine the starting and ending room
- Use "NeighborCount(object)" expression to find good places to place treasure.  A high amount of neighbors means that the tile is a nook or cranny.
- Use "IsRoomEntrance" condition to identify hallway objects that are adjacent to a room

## Actions

**Calculate the number of grid neighbors around an object**  
Calculate the number of grid neighbors around an object.  Use "NeighborCount(Object)" expression to retrieve this value.

**Generate a dungeon cave**  
Generate a dungeon cave using a random walk algorithm.  When the walker touches an edge of the map, it is moved back to the center of map.

**Generate a dungeon with room and hallways**  
Generate a dungeon by placing rooms in random locations and moving them if they collide with each other.  Rooms are connected with hallways.

## Conditions

**Hallway is a room entrance**  
Check if hallway is a room entrance.

## Expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `DungeonGenerator::NeighborCount(object)` | Number of grid neighbors of an object.  Requires running the "CalculateGridNeighbors" action before using this expression. ||
| | _object_ | Object |
| `DungeonGenerator::RoomID(object)` | The numerical order this room was created.  (Range: 1 to total number of rooms). ||
| | _object_ | Room object |
