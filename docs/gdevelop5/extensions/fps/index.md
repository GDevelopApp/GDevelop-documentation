Adds expressions to get the current FPS and a behavior to display the current FPS easily.

The FPS, Frames Per Second, describes how many times in the last second your game got updated. An update consists in running all the behaviors, objects, and events sheet code, before rendering the new game state into the game window. The higher the FPS, the more it manages to update in a second, influencing how fluid and performant your game looks.
