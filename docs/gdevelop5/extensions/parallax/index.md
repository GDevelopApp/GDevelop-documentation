## Horizontal Parallax for a Tiled Sprite 

Move the image of a Tiled Sprite to follow the camera horizontally with a parallax effect. After adding this to an object, put the object on a layer that is not moving, behind the layer that is followed (for example, a layer called "Background"). 

_No expressions for this behavior._


## Vertical Parallax for a Tiled Sprite 

Move the image of a Tiled Sprite to follow the camera vertically with a parallax effect. After adding this to an object, put the object on a layer that is not moving, behind the layer that is followed (for example, a layer called "Background"). 

_No expressions for this behavior._
