This extension provides: 
- Conditions to check if a global/scene/object variable exists.
- Actions to copy object variables, global and scene variables.
- Actions to delete an existing global/scene variable from memory.
- Actions to create a global/scene variable using a text expression, rather than a variable name input.
- Expressions to get the value or text from a global/scene variable using a text expression, rather than a variable name.

Text expressions allows to enter the name of the variable with an expression like `"MyVar"+ ToString(Variable(Health))`
