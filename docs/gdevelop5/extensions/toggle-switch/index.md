Add this behavior to a shape painter object.

When the toggle switch is in the *left* position, the condition `Checked` is "false". If it is in the *right* position, the condition `Checked` is true.
A halo appears when the mouse hovers near the toggle switch.

Toggle switch cannot be toggled by users if any of these are true:

- Toggle switch is hidden
- Toggle switch's layer is hidden
- Toggle switch is disabled

Toggle switch can always be changed by an action.
