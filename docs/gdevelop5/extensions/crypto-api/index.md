This uses the Crypto API to create a random number see help for more details. 

You might ask how this differs from the built-in random functions in GDevelop like RandomInRange. In basic terms, it provides a more random number than Math.random() which is what the built-in functions use.
That randomness does come at a cost of performance so be aware of your usage of this. 


**This has nothing to do with crypto currency**
