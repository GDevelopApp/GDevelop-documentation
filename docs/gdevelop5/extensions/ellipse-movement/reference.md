It allows objects to move:

- on an ellipsis or arcs
- smoothly vertically or horizontally (by setting one radius to 0)
- on a sine wave (by adding a force)

It can be used for:

- Making objects float, such as powerups or coins
- Moving platforms
- Enemy movement patterns
- Making a player constantly turn right or left ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://star-seeker))
