It allows objects to move:

- on an ellipsis or arcs
- smoothly vertically or horizontally (by setting one radius to 0)
- on a sine wave (by adding a force)

It can be used for:

- Making objects float, such as powerups or coins
- Moving platforms
- Enemy movement patterns
- Making a player constantly turn right or left ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://star-seeker))

## Ellipse movement 

Move objects on ellipses or smoothly back and forth in one direction. 

### Behavior actions

**Loop duration**  
Change the loop duration.

**Teleport at an angle**  
Change the movement angle. The object is teleported according to the angle.

**Radius X**  
Change the radius on X axis of the movement.

**Radius Y**  
Change the radius on Y axis of the movement.

**Turn left or right**  
Change the in which side the object is turning (left or right).

**Turn the other way**  
Change the turning direction (left or right).

### Behavior conditions

**Is turning left**  
Check if the object is turning left.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.EllipseMovement::CenterX()` | Return the movement center position on X axis. ||
| `Object.EllipseMovement::CenterY()` | Return the movement center position on Y axis. ||
| `Object.EllipseMovement::LoopDuration()` | Return the loop duration (in seconds). ||
| `Object.EllipseMovement::MovementAngle()` | Return the movement angle of the object. ||
