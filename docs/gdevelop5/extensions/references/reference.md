Adds actions to use references (variable that redirect any read/write to another variable) and pointers (unique numbers identifying a variable that can be resolved to a reference). Some usages are for callback variables in events based functions (getting a variable with a fixed name referring to a variable with a name passed as parameter), pointers to make advanced data structures like linked lists, and getting a top level variable dynamically.
