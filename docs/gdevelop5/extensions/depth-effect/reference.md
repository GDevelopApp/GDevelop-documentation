The scale of the object decreases the closer it is to the horizon, giving the illusion that the object is travelling away from the viewer.

Properties:
- Horizon Y position (Default: 0)
- Max scale of the object when it is at the bottom of the screen (Default: 1)
- Y exponent can be used to control the rate of change  (Default: 2)

Tips:
- If you want speed to look constant, be sure to reduce the object's speed based on scale or Y value.  If you don't do this, the object will appear to be moving faster when it is near the top of the screen.  This matches how objects appear in the real world.
- This extension works well with the Y-sort extension, which changes Z order based on Y position.
