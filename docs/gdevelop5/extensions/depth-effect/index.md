Change scale based on Y position to simulate depth of field.

The scale of the object decreases the closer it is to the horizon, giving the illusion that the object is travelling away from the viewer.

Properties:

- Horizon Y position (Default: 0)
- Max scale of the object when it is at the bottom of the screen (Default: 1)
- Y exponent can be used to control the rate of change  (Default: 2)

Tips:

- If you want speed to look constant, be sure to reduce the object's speed based on scale or Y value.  If you don't do this, the object will appear to be moving faster when it is near the top of the screen.  This matches how objects appear in the real world.
- This extension works well with the Y-sort extension, which changes Z order based on Y position.

## Depth effect 

The scale of the object decreases the closer it is to the horizon, giving the illusion that the object is travelling away from the viewer. 

### Behavior actions

**Set exponential rate of change**  
Set Y exponential rate of change (Default: 2).

**Set Y position of horizon**  
Set Y position of the horizon, where objects are infinitely small (Default: 0).

**Set max scale**  
Set max scale when the object is at the bottom of the screen (Default: 2).

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.DepthEffect_Sprite::ExponentY()` | Exponential rate of change, based on Y position. ||
| `Object.DepthEffect_Sprite::HorizonY()` | Y value of horizon. ||
| `Object.DepthEffect_Sprite::MaxScale()` | Max scale when the object is at the bottom of the screen. ||
| `Object.DepthEffect_Sprite::PercentAwayFromHorizon()` | Percent away from the horizon.  This is "0" at the horizon, and "1" at the bottom of the screen. ||
