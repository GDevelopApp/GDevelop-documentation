With this extension, you can load images from any URL (including a DataURL) into a sprite or image resource.
Loading it into a sprite will load the URL into a sprite, replacing the image it displays until the sprite's displayed image is changed, e.g. by going to the next frame of an animation or switching animations.
Loading it into a resource will discard the old image that a resource was using and replace it with the image loaded from a URL. Any sprite that is displaying this resource as a part of their animation will start showing the new image instead of the  old one. The old image of the resource will not be accessible anymore unless you restart the game or reload the original image from a URL into it.
