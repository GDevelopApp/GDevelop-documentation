Draws a draggable slider that users can move to select a numerical value.
The value range, tick spacing, and the appearance of the slider can be defined with properties.

How to use:

- Add this behavior a **Shape Painter** object
- Place an instance of that shape painter on the screen where you want the slider to appear
- Use the "Value" expression to find the Value based on the position of the slider

Tips:

- You can disable the slider to prevent a user from interacting with it
- You can set the Value of the slider and the slider will move to the correct position

Further details can be found in [this tutorial video](https://youtu.be/iiTUwdAT_hs).

Breaking changes (1.0.0)

- Track thickness and length properties replaced track width and height. These 2 properties must be set again if they were different from the default size.
- Hidden sliders can be dragged. The "enable" action must be used to disable them.
