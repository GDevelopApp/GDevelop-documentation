This extension allows to restyle a sprite, a tiled sprite or a panel sprite.

It can be used to:

- Change the color of player short according to its team color.
- Add small color variation to trees of a forest.
- Restyle objects to match other assets.

An example shows how to change the 2 main colors of an object ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://recolorizer)).

This extension is experimental and might no longer work in future version of GDevelop.
The [color map effect](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/layer-effects/#color-map) is the prefered way to recolorize 2D objects.
