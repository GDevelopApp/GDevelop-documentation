Noise can be useful for many procedural generation cases such as:

- Terrain, top down or side view ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://marching-squares-island-generator))
- Object positioning (tree, stars...)
- Curves (roads, rivers...)
- Textures (fog, milky way...)
- Screen shake
- Probably many other things

This extension contains expressions to generate Simplex noise values in 1, 2, 3 and 4 dimensions. A *"seed"* allows to generate the same world again later on instead of having to save the whole generated world.

Version 2.0.0 compatibility break:

- Seeds doesn't give the same result as with version 1.x.x
