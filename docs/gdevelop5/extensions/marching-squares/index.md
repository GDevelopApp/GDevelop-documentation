# Marching Squares (experimental)

<img src="https://resources.gdevelop-app.com/assets/Icons/peanut-outline.svg" class="extension-icon"></img>
Allow to build a "scalar field" and draw contour lines of it: useful for fog of wars, liquid effects, paint the ground, etc...

## Marching squares painter 

Add to a Shape painter object and use the actions to draw a field. Useful for fog of wars, liquid effects (water, lava, blobs...). 

### Behavior actions

**Add a disk**  
Add a disk to the field.

**Add a hill**  
Add a hill to the field.

**Add a line**  
Add a line to the field.

**Clamp the field**  
Cap every value of the field to a range.

**Clear the field**  
Clear the field by setting every values to 0.

**Draw the contours**  
Draw the field contours.

**Fill area**  
Fill an area of the field from a given location until a given hight is reached.

**Mask a disk**  
Mask a disk to the field.

**Mask a line**  
Mask a line to the field.

**Merge a field**  
Apply a given operation on every value of the field using the value from the other field at the same position.

**Area bounds**  
Change the field area bounds.

**Height of the cells**  
Change the height of the field cells.

**Width of the cells**  
Change the width of the field cells.

**Fill outside**  
Fill outside or inside of the contours.

**Grid value**  
Change the field value at a grid point.

**Contour threshold**  
Change the contour threshold.

**Transform the field**  
Apply an affine on the field values.

**Update hitboxes**  
Update the field hitboxes.

**Unfill area**  
Unfill an area of the field from a given location until a given hight is reached.

### Behavior conditions

**Field value**  
Check if a field is greater than a given value.

**Fill outside**  
Check if the contours are filled outside.

**Point is inside**  
Check if a point is inside the contour.

### Behavior expressions
