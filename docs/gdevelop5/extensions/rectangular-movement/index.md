Allow an object to move in a rectangular pattern.
By default, movement will slow down when going around corners, but this can be changed to always use a constant speed.

Example uses:

- Moveable platforms
- Enemy movement patterns

Properties:

- Center of movement, X position
- Center of movement, Y position
- Horizontal distance
- Vertical distance
- Horizontal speed
- Vertical speed
- Use constant speed (object will not slow down at corners)
- Use counter-clockwise direction

Tips:

- Set the CenterX and CenterY values to move the object
- For horizontal movement only, set vertical distance to 0
- For vertical movement only, set horizontal distance to 0
- Use conditions to apply logic based on the direction the object is moving.  For example, setting the animation.
