This extension makes objects sway at different times.

It can be used to:

- Simulate grass and plant movement swaying in the wind
- Animate seaweed in an underwater environment
- Give flames a flickering look 

Set *Center* and *Origin* points to the center base of the object for best results.

Check out [this demo](https://liluo.io/bubble/swayexamples) to see what this extension can do.
