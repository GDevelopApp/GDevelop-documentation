Animate text to simulate it being written one character at at time (a "typewriter" effect), with a customizable time between each character. Useful for dialogue scenes or visual novels.

How to use:

- Add the behavior to a Text object (BBText, Bitmap Text object) and choose the interval between characters.

Tips:

- Change the typing speed with the "Change interval" action.
- Pause the typing and resume it at any time.
- Use the "Skip to end of text" action to give users a way to skip text they don't want to read 
- If the text changes, the automatic typing starts again from the beginning with the new text.
- Use a condition to check if the typing finished.
- Use a condition to check if a new text character was added. This is useful to trigger audio effects.
- Use the "CurrentCharacter" expression to know when a specific character was displayed.
