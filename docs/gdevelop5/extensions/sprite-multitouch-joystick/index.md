Multitouch joysticks can be used the same way as physical gamepads:

- 4 or 8 directions
- Analogus pads
- Player selection
- Controls mapping for top-down movement and platformer characters

There are ready-to-use joysticks in the asset-store [multitouch joysticks pack](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=asset-store&asset-pack=multitouch-joysticks-multitouch-joysticks).

## Conditions

**Multitouch controller button pressed**  
Check if a button is pressed on a gamepad.

**Multitouch controller button released**  
Check if a button is released on a gamepad.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (4-way)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (8-way)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Stick force**  
Compare the force of multitouch contoller stick (from 0 to 1).

## Expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `SpriteMultitouchJoystick::StickAngle(number, string)` | Return the angle the multitouch controller stick is pointing towards (Range: -180 to 180). ||
| | _number_ | Multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...) |
| | _string_ | Joystick name |
| `SpriteMultitouchJoystick::StickForce(number, string)` | Return the force of multitouch contoller stick (from 0 to 1). ||
| | _number_ | Multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...) |
| | _string_ | Stick name |
| `SpriteMultitouchJoystick::StickForceX(number, string)` | Return the multitouch contoller stick force on X axis (from -1 at the left to 1 at the right). ||
| | _number_ | Multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...) |
| | _string_ | Joystick name |
| `SpriteMultitouchJoystick::StickForceY(number, string)` | Return the multitouch contoller stick force on Y axis (from -1 at the top to 1 at the bottom). ||
| | _number_ | Multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...) |

## Multitouch Joystick 

Joystick for touchscreens. 

### Object actions

**De/activate control**  
De/activate control of the joystick.

**Flip the object horizontally**  
Flip the object horizontally

**Flip the object vertically**  
Flip the object vertically

**Height**  
Change the height of an object.

**Scale**  
Modify the scale of the specified object.

**Multitouch controller identifier**  
Change the multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...).

**Dead zone radius**  
Change the dead zone radius of the joystick (range: 0 to 1). The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved).

**Joystick name**  
Change the joystick name of the object.

**Opacity**  
Change the opacity of an object, between 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (opaque).

**Scale on X axis**  
Change the width's scale of an object.

**Scale on Y axis**  
Change the height's scale of an object.

**Width**  
Change the width of an object.

### Object conditions

**Multitouch controller identifier**  
Compare the multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...).

**Dead zone radius**  
Compare the dead zone radius of the joystick (range: 0 to 1). The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved).

**Horizontally flipped**  
Check if the object is horizontally flipped

**Vertically flipped**  
Check if the object is vertically flipped

**Joystick pushed in a direction (4-way movement)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (8-way movement)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Stick pressed**  
Check if a stick is pressed.

**Joystick name**  
Compare the joystick name of the object.

**Opacity**  
Compare the opacity of an object, between 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (opaque).

**Scale on X axis**  
Compare the width's scale of an object.

**Scale on Y axis**  
Compare the height's scale of an object.

**Stick force**  
Compare the strick force (from 0 to 1).

**Stick X force**  
Compare the stick force on X axis (from -1 at the left to 1 at the right).

**Stick Y force**  
Compare the stick force on Y axis (from -1 at the top to 1 at the bottom).

### Object expressions

| `Object.JoystickIdentifier()` | Return the joystick name of the object. ||
| `Object.Opacity()` | Return the opacity of an object, between 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (opaque). ||
| `Object.ScaleX()` | Return the width's scale of an object. ||
| `Object.ScaleY()` | Return the height's scale of an object. ||
| `Object.StickAngle()` | Return the angle the stick is pointing towards (from -180 to 180). ||
| `Object.StickForce()` | Return the strick force (from 0 to 1). ||
| `Object.StickForceX()` | Return the stick force on X axis (from -1 at the left to 1 at the right). ||
