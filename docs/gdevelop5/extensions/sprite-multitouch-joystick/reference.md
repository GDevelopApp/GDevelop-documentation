Multitouch joysticks can be used the same way as physical gamepads:
- 4 or 8 directions
- Analogus pads
- Player selection
- Controls mapping for top-down movement and platformer characters

There are ready-to-use joysticks in the asset-store [multitouch joysticks pack](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=asset-store&asset-pack=multitouch-joysticks-multitouch-joysticks).
