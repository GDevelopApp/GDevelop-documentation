Shake layer cameras with translation, rotation and zoom.
- Short shaking can be used to give impact (explosion, hit)
- Shaking can go indefinitely to set an ambiance (engine vibration, earthquake, pulsing)
- Low frequency shaking allows to simulate slow moving objects (ship rocking back and forth)
- Setting amplitudes per layer make it possible to respect the parallax and give more depth

Release notes:
- Version 3.0.0
    - No adaptation of the game events is needed.
    - It fixes an issue when used with scrolling, the amplitude will feel bigger in this case.
    - The shaking relies on noise which could feel a bit different.
    - This extension can no longer do impulses. For this, another extension "Camera impulse" can be used.
