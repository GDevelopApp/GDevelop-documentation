Shake layer cameras with translation, rotation and zoom.


- Short shaking can be used to give impact (explosion, hit)
- Shaking can go indefinitely to set an ambiance (engine vibration, earthquake, pulsing)
- Low frequency shaking allows to simulate slow moving objects (ship rocking back and forth)

Release notes:

- Version 3.0.0
    - No adaptation of the game events is needed.
    - It fixes an issue when used with scrolling, the amplitude will feel bigger in this case.
    - The shaking relies on noise which could feel a bit different.
    - This extension can no longer do impulses. For this, another extension "Camera impulse" can be used.

## Actions

**Default rotation amplitude**  
Change the default rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Default shaking frequency**  
Change the default number of back and forth per seconds.

**Default translation amplitude**  
Change the default translation amplitude of the shaking (in pixels).

**Default zoom amplitude**  
Change the default zoom factor amplitude of the shaking. The shaking will zoom and unzoom by this factor (for instance 1.0625 is a valid value).

**Layer rotation amplitude**  
Change the rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Shakable layer**  
Mark a layer as shakable.

**Layer shaking frequency**  
Change the number of back and forth per seconds.

**Layer translation amplitude**  
Change the translation amplitude of the shaking (in pixels).

**Layer zoom amplitude**  
Change the zoom factor amplitude of the shaking. The shaking will zoom and unzoom by this factor (for instance 1.0625 is a valid value).

**Shake camera**  
Shake the camera on layers chosen with configuration actions.

**Start camera shaking**  
Start shaking the camera indefinitely.

**Stop camera shaking**  
Stop shaking the camera.

## Conditions

**Camera is shaking**  
Check if the camera is shaking.
