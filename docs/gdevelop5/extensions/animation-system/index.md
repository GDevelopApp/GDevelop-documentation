Helpful for making animations for sprites without having to spend time animating the character in editors

-You can use multi animations on one object to get more effects
-For the animations that do Not have Trigger once, you can use Timers to make it Have one !
-Added condition to check if the door is Open or Close from animation (3D open/close door)
-Added condition to check if the animation has finished (if trigger once set to YES)
-User can change the origin point of the object to control the animations
