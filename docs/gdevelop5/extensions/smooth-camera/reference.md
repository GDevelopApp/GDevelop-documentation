The camera follows an object according to:

- a frame rate independent catch-up speed to make the scrolling from smooth to strong
- a maximum speed to do linear following ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://platformer-with-tilemap)) or slow down the camera when teleporting the object
- a follow-free zone to avoid scrolling on small movements
- an offset to see further in one direction
- an extra delay and catch-up speed to give an impression of speed (useful for dash)
- position forecasting and delay to simulate a cameraman response time

A platformer dedicated behavior allows to switch of settings when the character is in air or on the floor. This can be used to stabilize the camera when jumping.
