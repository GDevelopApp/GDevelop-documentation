This extension allows to move objects on Bézier curve paths.

- Paths can be built dynamically or from predetermined paths in SVG format.
- A behavior moves objects in a given duration a bit like the Tween extension does.
- Another behavior moves objects using a speed and an acceleration.
- Expressions give access to the path trajectory values for more complex movements.

This extension can be used to:

- Move enemies that follow a pattern
- Animate decorations

A collection of [small examples](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://curved-movement) show how to use this extension.
