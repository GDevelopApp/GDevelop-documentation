This extension allows to move objects on BÃ©zier curve paths.

- Paths can be built dynamically or from predetermined paths in SVG format.
- A behavior moves objects in a given duration a bit like the Tween extension does.
- Another behavior moves objects using a speed and an acceleration.
- Expressions give access to the path trajectory values for more complex movements.

This extension can be used to:

- Move enemies that follow a pattern
- Animate decorations

A collection of [small examples](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://curved-movement) shows how to use this extension.

2 examples use it:

- a 3D racing game ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://3d-racing-game))
- a Zuma-like ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://smoothy))

## Actions

**Append a curve**  
Append a cubic Bezier curve at the end of the path.

**Append a line**  
Append a line at the end of the path.

**Append a smooth curve**  
Append a cubic Bezier curve to the end of an object's path. The first control point is symmetrical to the last control point of the path.

**Append a path**  
Append a path to another path.

**Append a rotated path**  
Append a path to another path. The appended path is rotated to have a smooth junction.

**Close a path**  
Append a line to close the path.

**Create a path from SVG**  
Create a path from SVG commands, for instance "M 0,0 C 55,0 100,45 100,100". Commands are: M = Move, C = Curve, S = Smooth, L = Line. Lower case is for relative positions. The preferred way to build the commands is to use an external SVG editor like Inkscape.

**Delete a path**  
Delete a path from the memory.

**Duplicate a path**  
Duplicate a path.

**Invert a path**  
Invert a path, the end becomes the beginning.

**Rotate a path**  
Rotate a path.

**Scale a path**  
Scale a path.

**Speed scale Y**  
Change the speed scale on Y axis. This allows to change the view point of a path (top-dwon or isometry).

## Conditions

**Is  closed**  
Check if a path is closed.

**Path exists**  
Path exists.

## Movement on a curve (speed-based) 

Move objects on curved paths at a given speed. 

### Behavior actions

**Accelerate**  
Make an object accelerate until it reaches a given speed.

**Accelerate during**  
Make an object accelerate to reaches a speed in a given amount of time.

**Draw the trajectory**  
Draw the object trajectory.

**Follow a path**  
Change the path followed by an object.

**Follow a path to a position**  
Change the path followed by an object to reach a position.

**Position on the path**  
Change the length between the trajectory origin and the current position.

**Speed**  
Change the speed of the object.

### Behavior conditions

**Can move further**  
Check if the object can still move in the current direction.

**Current length**  
Check if the length from the trajectory origin is lesser than a value.

**Reach an end**  
Check if the object has reached one of the 2 ends of the path.

**Reached path origin**  
Check if the object has reached the origin position of the path.

**Reached path target**  
Check if the object has reached the target position of the path.

**Position on the path**  
Compare the length between the trajectory origin and the current position.

**Speed**  
Compare the speed of the object.
