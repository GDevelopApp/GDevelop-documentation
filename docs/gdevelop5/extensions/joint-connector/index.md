Weld joint

- Glue two objects together
- Joint is created at the center of the Joint Connector object

Revolute joint

- Two objects are connected but can rotate on the joint
- Angles can be restricted and joints can have motors that spin the objects
- Joint is created at the center of the Joint Connector object

Distance joint

- Two objects are forced to stay at set distance from each other
- Adjust the frequency property to change the stiffness of the spring
- Center of both objects must be inside the Joint Connector collision mask

Rope joint

- Two objects can get closer to each other but they cannot exceed their starting distance
- Center of both objects must be inside the Joint Connector collision mask

## Actions

**Connect objects with a distance joint**  
Connect physics objects with a distance joint if the joint connector covers the center point of both objects.

**Connect overlapping objects with a revolute joint**  
Connect overlapping physics objects with a revolute joint.

**Connect objects with a rope joint**  
Connect physics objects with a rope joint if the joint connector covers the center point of both objects.

**Connect overlapping objects with a weld joint**  
Connect overlapping physics objects with a weld joint.



## Distance joint connector 

Create and manage distance joints between two objects. 
Acts like a spring because the objects try to stay the same distance apart. 

### Behavior actions

**Break distance joint if it exceeds breaking force**  
Break distance joint if it exceeds breaking force.

**Set the breaking force of a joint**  
Set the breaking force of a joint.

**Set damping ratio of joint**  
Set dampting ratio of joint.  Range: 0 to 1.

**Set frequency of joint**  
Set frequency of joint.  Range: 0 to 60 (or the maximum FPS of game).

_No expressions for this behavior._


## Revolute joint connector 

Create and manage revolute joints between two objects.
Also known as a hinge joint because the objects act like they are connected with a hinge that pivots. 

### Behavior actions

**Break revolute joint if it exceeds breaking force**  
Break revolute joint if it exceeds breaking force.

**Set the breaking force of a joint**  
Set the breaking force of a joint.

**Set clockwise angle limit of joint**  
Set clockwise angle limit of joint.

**Set counter-clockwise angle limit of joint**  
Set counter-clockwise angle limit of joint.

**Enable (or disable) angle limits on joint**  
Enable (or disable) angle limits on joint.

**Enable (or disable) motor of joint**  
Enable (or disable) motor of joint.

**Motor enabled (or disabled) on joint**  
Change if motor enabled (or disabled) on joint.

**Set motor rotation speed of joint**  
Set motor rotation speed of joint.

**Set motor strength of joint**  
Set motor strength (torque) of joint.

### Behavior conditions

**Motor enabled (or disabled) on joint**  
Check if motor enabled (or disabled) on joint.

_No expressions for this behavior._


## Rope joint connector 

Create and manage rope joints between two objects. 
Objects can get closer, but they cannot exceed the starting distance from each other.
 

### Behavior actions

**Break rope joint if it exceeds breaking force**  
Break rope joint if it exceeds breaking force.

**Breaking force**  
Change the force required to break joint apart.

**Damping ratio**  
Change the damping ratio of the object. Set a number between 0 and 1.

**Frequency**  
Change the frequency of the object. Set a number between 0 and 60. Higher numbers represent a stiffer spring.

**Max distance between objects**  
Change the max distance between objects.

### Behavior conditions

**Breaking force**  
Compare the force required to break joint apart.

**Damping ratio**  
Compare the damping ratio of the object. Set a number between 0 and 1.

**Frequency**  
Compare the frequency of the object. Set a number between 0 and 60. Higher numbers represent a stiffer spring.

**Max distance between objects**  
Compare the max distance between objects.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.RopeJoint::BreakingForce()` | Return the force required to break joint apart. ||
| `Object.RopeJoint::DampingRatio()` | Return the damping ratio of the object. Set a number between 0 and 1. ||
| `Object.RopeJoint::Frequency()` | Return the frequency of the object. Set a number between 0 and 60. Higher numbers represent a stiffer spring. ||
| `Object.RopeJoint::MaxDistance()` | Return the max distance between objects. ||

## Weld joint connector 

Create and manage weld joints between two objects.
Also known as a static joint because the objects stay glued in the same relative position to each other. 

### Behavior actions

**Break weld joint if it exceeds breaking force**  
Break weld joint if it exceeds breaking force.

**Set the breaking force of a joint**  
Set the breaking force of a joint.

**Set frequency of joint**  
Set frequency of joint.  Range: 0 to 60 (or the maximum FPS of game).

_No expressions for this behavior._
