How To Use:

- Place target objects in the scene in the places you want fill objects to be created
- This action only needs to be run once (at the beginning of the scene or using TriggerOnce)

Object variables (Fill objects): 

- "CreationID" (number)
- "RowID" (number)
- "ColumnID" (number)
- "BatchID" (text)

Tips:

- Use fill objects that are the same size as the scene editor grid.  This will make sure the fill objects fit exactly inside the target objects.
- Hide target objects at the beginning of the scene if you don't want them to be visible.
- Keep the default origin point (top-left corner) on fill objects them to line up exactly with target objects.
