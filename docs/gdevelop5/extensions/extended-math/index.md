# Extended math support

<img src="https://resources.gdevelop-app.com/assets/Icons/function-variant.svg" class="extension-icon"></img>
Additional math functions and constants as expressions and conditions.

**Authors and contributors** to this community extension: [Add00](https://gd.games/Add00), [Jurfix](https://gd.games/Jurfix).

---

Expressions:

 - Mathematical constants
 - Greatest common factor/Lowest common multiple
 - Factorial
 - Coordinates conversion for polar and isometric systems
 - ToFixedString: Formats a number into a string with the specified number of decimal places
 - ToFixed: (Deprecated) Formats a number to use the specified number of decimal places

Conditions:

- IsEven: Check if the number is even (divisible by 2)

Release Notes:

Version 1.0.7

- Added ToFixedString()
- Deprecated ToFixed() because it does not show any trailing zeros for whole numbers. Prefer using ToFixedString() to set values in text objects.

## Conditions

**Is even?**  
Check if the number is even (divisible by 2).  To check for odd numbers, invert this condition.
