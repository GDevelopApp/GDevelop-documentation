Limit the maximum movement and rotation speed of an object from forces or the physics behavior.

How to use:

- Add the behavior that matches the method used to move the object (forces or physics)
- Set the maximum speed value in the behavior properties

Tips:

- This only affects movement caused by forces or physics behavior
- This may not affect movement caused by other behaviors (platformer, top-down, draggable, etc)
