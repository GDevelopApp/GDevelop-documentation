# Install new extensions

## Search for extensions

!!! tip

    You can browse the [list of GDevelop extensions here](/gdevelop5/extensions).

Finding **new behaviors, conditions, actions or expressions** for your game in GDevelop is easy. In the [Project Manager](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager), click on *Create or search for new extensions*:

![](/gdevelop5/extensions/search/pasted/20230305-114603.png)

All the extensions from the GDevelop ecosystem will be shown:

![](/gdevelop5/extensions/search/pasted/20230305-114648.png)

Type something in the search bar to filter extensions according to what you would like.

Extensions are presented with their names, followed by a short description. This should give you an idea of what the extension can do in your game.

## Install an extension

If you find an interesting extension, click on it to open a window with more details. For example, here is an overview of the "Flash (blink)" extension:

The description usually explains how to use the extension. Here, it is a behavior that you can add to an object, with an action to make the object flash for a bit of time (like in old platformer, when you are hit by an enemy).

Click on **Install in project** to download the extension. You can see it is then added to the list of extensions in the [Project Manager](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager):

## Use the new extension

Once the extension is installed, you can usually:

  * Find it in the list of **behaviors**, when [adding a new behavior](/gdevelop5/behaviors) to an object.
  * Even if no behavior is provided, you'll have some **actions or conditions**. Find them in the list of actions or conditions when editing an event. The name of the category containing them is the same as the extension.

For example, the *Flash* behavior provides 2 new actions:

They can be used on objects which have the *Flash* behavior attached.

## Create your own behaviors, actions, conditions or expressions

It's possible to easily create new extensions, using the same events that you're using in the scenes. It's a powerful feature that allows you to organize your game and extend your objects.

Read more about [creating your own extensions here](/gdevelop5/extensions/create).

# Add an extension manually

On the desktop version of GDevelop, click the button *Import extension*, next to "Create a new extension", to import an extension from a `.json` file.
