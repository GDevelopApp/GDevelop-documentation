This provides behaviors that provide jump enhancements for the platformer character:

* The air jump behavior lets platformer characters jump in mid-air.
* The wall jump behavior lets platformer characters jump and slide against walls.
* The coyote time behavior, also known as "ledge tolerance", lets players to jump even after their character is no longer touching the ground for a given amount of time. It aims to give players a feeling of control and reduce frustration.
