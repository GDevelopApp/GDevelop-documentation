This extension provides behaviors to:


* Jump in mid-air
* Jump and slide against walls
* Dash horizontally
* Dash toward the floor
* Do coyote time, also known as "ledge tolerance". It lets players jumping even after their character is no longer touching the ground for a given amount of time. It aims to give players a feeling of control and reduce frustration.

An example allows to check it out ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://platformer-moves)).
