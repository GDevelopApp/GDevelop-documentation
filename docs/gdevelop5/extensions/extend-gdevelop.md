# Extending GDevelop (with JavaScript or C++)

GDevelop is modular. It can be extended to suit your needs. In particular, all the features available for the games (objects, behaviors, and events) are based on a extension system. Since GDevelop is [open-source](https://github.com/4ian/GD), you can contribute to the existing extensions or you can create new ones. You can also take a look at the game engine or the editor source code and develop improvements.

!!! tip
    
        
    ➡️ If you are looking for event based functions, see **[functions](/gdevelop5/events/functions)**. For event based behaviors see **[event based behaviors](/gdevelop5/behaviors/events-based-behaviors)**.
    
    If you have made useful functions and behaviors, consider [sharing them with the community](/gdevelop5/extensions/share).

## Extensions for the game engine (JavaScript)

All features provided by the game engine are based on the game engine core (GDJS) and extensions.

➡️If you want to create new objects, new behaviors, or new actions/conditions/expressions, read **[this page about creating and developing extensions for GDevelop](https://github.com/4ian/GD/blob/master/newIDE/README-extensions.md)**.

You will need Node.js to get started and rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript.

## Improve the editor (JavaScript, C++)

The editor is based on JavaScript too, and you can easily modify and improve it.

➡️Read [this page to start working on the editor](https://github.com/4ian/GD/blob/master/newIDE/README.md).

You will need Node.js to get started and knowledge of JavaScript. It's also a good idea to read tutorials about React.js - as the whole editor is based on it for modularity and performance.

### Creating themes

You can create new themes for GDevelop. Read more about [theme creation here](/gdevelop5/all-features/themes).
