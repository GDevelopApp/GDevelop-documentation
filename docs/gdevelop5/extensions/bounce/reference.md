Provides an action to make the object bounce from another object it just touched. Add a permanent force to the object and, when in collision with another one, use the action to make it bounce realistically.

There are also actions to bounce at a *specific angle* - useful when you know the obstacle must generate a bounce that is always in a specific direction.

> ⚠️ This *won't work* with Physics engine or Platformer characters. This is working with objects that are moved using actions or behaviors using **the forces**.
