## Actions

**Add Child**  
Add 3D Object as child to 3D object.

**3D Camera Look At 3D Object**  
3D Camera Look At 3D Object

**Change 3D Camera FOV**  
Change the Field Of View of the 3D Camera.

**Change 3D Camera Far**  
Change the far property of 3D Camera.  
The 3D Camera will not render 3D Objects farther than this distance.

**Change 3D Camera Near**  
Change the near property of the 3D Camera.  
The 3D Camera will not render 3D Objects closer than this distance.

**Change 3D Camera Zoom**  
Change 3D Camera Zoom

**Change 3D Texture**  
Change the 3D Texture of a 3D Object.

**Change 3D Object DepthWrite (experimental)**  
Change the DepthWrite of a 3D Object.  
Whether rendering this 3D Object has any effect on the depth buffer.
If transparent 3D Objects overlap and render incorrectly, you may be able to obtain ideal rendering results by setting the DepthWrite of that 3D Object to No.
Default is Yes.

**Change Master Volume Of 3D Scene**  
Change Master Volume Of 3D Scene

**Change 3D Object Opacity**  
Change the Opacity of a 3D Object.  
The same value is set for multiple textures.

**Change 3D Object Scale**  
Change the Scale of a 3D Object.  
Note that 3D Sprite and 3D Model were scaled when created.

**Change 3D Object Visibility**  
Change the visibility of a 3D Object.

**Clear 3D Scene**  
Clear 3D Scene. Removes all 3D Objects in the 3D Scene.  
As a result, this action also removes 2D Objects that have 3D Projection Behaviors.
This action does not clear the loaded 3D Texture data and the loaded 3D Model data.
They will continue to be accessible by ID.

**Correct 3D Camera Rotation Within Limits (experimental)**

Unlimited with Min = -180 and Max = 180.
Rotation is corrected like head movement. Limiting multiple axes can break things.

This action does not clear the loaded 3D Texture data and the loaded 3D Model data.
They will continue to be accessible by ID.

**Resolve Bounding Box Collision**  
Resolve collisions between Bounding Boxes.  
It is not necessary to use the "Check Bounding Box Collision" condition beforehand. (It will do almost the same processing)
Note that the 3D Objects are still in contact after resolution. ("Check Bounding Box Collision" condition will not be false.)
3D Object thickness too thin for the amount of movement will not resolve correctly.
This action updates the "Bounding Box Collision Result".

## Conditions

**Check 3D Sound Is Playing**  
Check if 3D Sound is playing.

**Check Bounding Box Collision**  
Checks for collisions between the Bounding Boxes of two 3D Objects.  
This condition updates the "Bounding Box Collision Result" when it returns True.
