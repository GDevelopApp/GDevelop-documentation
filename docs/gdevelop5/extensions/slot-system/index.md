- Check how many slots are filled or empty
- Set a maximum or unlimited amount of items for every slot
- Add and remove properties of a slot (weapon category, item class, object weight...)
- Move a slot content to an other position
- Sum a property (good for weight system)
- Sort items using a property value (ascending alphabetical only)
- Flood system : add items automatically and when they reach the maximum of the slot, they go in the next empty slot
- Export/Import spaces as JSON

## Systems

- 3 systems available (Basic, Named slots and Grid)
### Basic
Use numbers as slot identifiers to retrieve your informations
### Named slots
Use texts as slot identifiers. Very useful when you want to put an item on a specific part of your character.
### Grid
Use a 2D grid position to retrieve your informations. It uses the basic slot system in a more handy way.
