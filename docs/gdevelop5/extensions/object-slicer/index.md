Useful for creating death animations such as explosions, crumbling, dissolve, or teleportation effects.
Object used for pieces should be a solid white color (otherwise the color will not match the original object color).

Tips:

- Adjust the collision mask to control where pieces will be created,
- Pieces are linked to the original object which can be used in other events (i.e. explode away from the original object)
