Useful for creating death animations such as explosions, crumbling, dissolve, or teleportation effects.
Pieces should be a solid white color or the color of the piece will not match the original color.

Tips:

- Adjust the collision mask to control where pieces will be created
- Pieces are linked to the original object which can be used in other events (i.e. explode away from the original object)
