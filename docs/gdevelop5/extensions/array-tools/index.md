> Note: This extension is currently made in JavaScript instead of the event sheet as variables cannot be passed to events based functions yet. Due to this hack, the extension **only works on root scene variables**, not on child variables or non-scene variables.

This extension adds features like:

- Combining arrays (concatenate into new array, append all children to another array)
- Finding a value in an array (find index expression, contains condition)
- Reversing arrays
- Get a portion of an array (slice)
- Add and remove lots of children at specific indices at once (fill, splice, shift, pop, add at index)
- Randomness (shuffle children, get a random child)
- Mathematical operations using arrays (sum of all numbers, biggest/smallest number, average number, median number)
- Sort numbers in an array
- String inter-operation (split string into array, join array array children to string)

## Actions

**Append all variable to another array**  
Appends a copy of all variables of one array to another array.

**Combine 2 arrays**  
Combines all elements of 2 scene arrays into one new scene array.

**Fill array with number**  
Fill an element with a number.

**Flatten array**  
Replaces all arrays inside of an array with their children. For example, [[1,2], [3,4]] becomes [1,2,3,4].

**Insert variable at**  
Insert a variable at a specific index of an array.

**Pop array child**  
Removes the last array child of an array, and stores it in another variable.

**Reverse an array**  
Reverses children of an array. The first array child becomes the last, and the last array child becomes the first.

**Shift array child**  
Removes the first array child of an array, and stores it in another variable.

**Shuffle array**  
Shuffles all children of an array.

**Slice an array**  
Copies a portion of a scene array variable into a new scene array variable.

**Sort an array**  
Sort an array of number from smallest to biggest.

**Splice an array**  
Cuts a portion of an array off.

**Split string into array**  
Split a string into an array of strings via a separator.

## Conditions

**Array has number**  
Checks if an array contains a specific number.

**Array has string**  
Checks if an array contains a specific string.
