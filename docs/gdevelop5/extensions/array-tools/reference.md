> Note: This extension is currently made in JavaScript instead of the event sheet as variables cannot be passed to events based functions yet. Due to this hack, the extension **only works on root scene variables**, not on child variables or non-scene variables.

This extension adds features like:
- Combining arrays (concatenate into new array, append all children to another array)
- Finding a value in an array (find index expression, contains condition)
- Reversing arrays
- Get a portion of an array (slice)
- Add and remove lots of children at specific indices at once (fill, splice, shift, pop, add at index)
- Randomness (shuffle children, get a random child)
- Mathematical operations using arrays (sum of all numbers, biggest/smallest number, average number, median number)
- Sort numbers in an array
- String inter-operation (split string into array, join array array children to string)
