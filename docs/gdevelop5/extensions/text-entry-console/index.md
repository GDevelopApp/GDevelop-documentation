A behavior that makes a Text Entry behave like a console. Whenever Return is pressed, the Text Entry is cleared and the entered text parsed, and the first word is stored as the command name, and the rest as arguments. Each word is one argument, and you can get them with the expression `GetArg`. When a command is triggered, it triggers the condition bound to this command. Example:  
If you have entered `hello foo bar` and Return, then the condition `Entered command "hello"` will trigger, `Object::Console.GetArg(0)` will return `"foo"`, and `Object::Console.GetArg(1)` will return `"bar"`.
