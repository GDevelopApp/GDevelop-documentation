## Top-down walk 

Turn and move objects forward and sideways. 

### Behavior actions

**Current forward speed**  
Change the current forward speed of the object.

**Current rotation speed**  
Change the current rotation speed of the object.

**Current sideways speed**  
Change the current sideways speed of the object.

**Rotation acceleration**  
Change the rotation acceleration of the object.

**Rotation deceleration**  
Change the rotation deceleration of the object.

**Maximum rotation speed**  
Change the maximum rotation speed of the object.

**Acceleration**  
Change the acceleration of the object.

**Deceleration**  
Change the deceleration of the object.

**Maximum speed**  
Change the maximum speed of the object.

**Simulate move backward key press**  
Simulate a press of the move backward key.

**Simulate move forward key press**  
Simulate a press of the move forward key.

**Simulate move left key press**  
Simulate a press of the move left key.

**Simulate move right key press**  
Simulate a press of the move right key.

**Simulate stick control**  
Simulate a stick control.

**Simulate stick control for rotation**

Compare the rotation acceleration of the object.

**Rotation deceleration**  
Compare the rotation deceleration of the object.

**Maximum rotation speed**  
Compare the maximum rotation speed of the object.

**Acceleration**  
Compare the acceleration of the object.

**Deceleration**  
Compare the deceleration of the object.

**Maximum speed**  
Compare the maximum speed of the object.
