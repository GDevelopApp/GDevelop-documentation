Run the provided action (*on every frame*, i.e: without a condition) to make the orbiting objects move.
The extension will take care of creating/deleting orbiting objects to match the quantity specified. 
Use the delete function or set the quantity to 0 to remove orbiting objects.

The customizable parameters include:

- Which center object to use
- Orbiting object (cannot be the same object used for the Center object)
- Quantity of orbiting objects
- Distance from the center object
- Speed of the orbiting objects (in degrees per second).  Use negative numbers to orbit counter-clockwise.
- Speed to rotate each orbiting object (in degrees per second).  Use negative numbers to rotate counter-clockwise.

Example uses:

- Make shield objects around the player to protect from enemies
- Weapons that can damage enemies when they collide
- Can be used on both player and NPC objects 
- A visual indicator of ammo quantity or health points
- Interesting animations that can function as a single entity (try using short orbit distances)
- Visual cue for an active character power-up, such as invincibility
