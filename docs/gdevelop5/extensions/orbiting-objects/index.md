Run the actions on every frame to make the orbiting objects move.
The extension will automatically create/delete orbiting objects to match the quantity specified. 
Use the delete function or set the quantity to 0 to remove all orbiting objects.

The *elliptical orbit* action can be used to create a 3D effect by changing the z-order of orbiting objects.

The customizable parameters include:

- Center object
- Orbiting object (must be different than the Center object)
- Quantity of orbiting objects
- Distance from the center object
- Speed of the orbiting objects (in degrees per second).  Use negative numbers to orbit counter-clockwise.
- Speed to rotate each orbiting object (in degrees per second).  Use negative numbers to rotate counter-clockwise.

Example uses:

- Make shield objects around the player to protect from enemies
- Weapons that can damage enemies when they collide
- A visual indicator of ammo quantity or health points
- Interesting animations of stacked objects that can function as a single entity 
- Visual cue for an active character power-up, such as invincibility
