Shake an object (position, angle or scale).

It can be used for:

- Hit or impact
- Object slowly rocking back and forth (like a ship)
- Simulate engine vibration, earthquake, or pulsing

The top-down RPG example uses this extension for damage animations ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://top-down-rpg)).
