In comparison to the built-in pathfinding behavior, this one aims to:

- better respect obstacle shapes
- find paths faster if obstacles don't move

The isometric example shows how to use this extension to move a character to a destination ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://isometric-game)).

## Navigation mesh pathfinding animator 

Change the animation according to the movement direction. 

### Behavior actions

**Animation name**  
Change the animation name of the object.

**Scale animation according to speed**  
Change whether the animation is scaled according to speed or not.

### Behavior conditions

**Animation name**  
Compare the animation name of the object.

**Scale animation according to speed**  
Check if the animation is scaled according to speed.

### Behavior expressions

## Obstacle for navigation mesh pathfinding (experimental) 

Flag objects as being an obstacle for pathfinding. 

### Behavior actions

**Area bottom bound**  
Change the area bottom bound. The bottom bound of the area where objects can go in the scene (default to the game resolution). While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.

**Area left bound**  
Change the area left bound. The left bound of the area where objects can go in the scene. While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.

**Area right bound**  
Change the area right bound. The right bound of the area where objects can go in the scene (default to the game resolution). While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.

**Area top bound**  
Change the area top bound. The top bound of the area where objects can go in the scene. While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.

**Cell size**  
Change the cell size for obstacle collision mask rasterization. While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.
