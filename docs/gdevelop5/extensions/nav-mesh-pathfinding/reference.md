In comparison to the built-in pathfinding behavior, this one aims to:

- better respect obstacle shapes
- find paths faster if obstacles don't move

The isometric example shows how to use this extension to move a character to a destination ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://isometric-game)).
