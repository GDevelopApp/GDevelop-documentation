Drag a physics object with the mouse (or touch).

Enables players to click and drag on physics objects to move them.  The object retains velocity when the click is released, allowing players to fling objects across the screen.

Note:

- The default "draggable" behavior will not work on objects with the physics behavior. This extension should be used instead.
- This extension will only work on objects that have the physics behavior.
- Kinematic physics mode is incompatible with this extension. The object will be changed to dynamic mode.

The Parking Jam example uses this extension ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://parking-jam)).

## Draggable (for physics objects) 

Drag a physics object with the mouse (or touch). 

### Behavior actions

**Release dragged object**  
Release dragged object.

**Damping ratio**  
Change the joint damping ratio (range: 0 to 1) of the object. 

**Enable (or disable) automatic dragging**  
Enable (or disable) automatic dragging with the mouse or touch.

**Frequency**  
Change the joint frequency (per second) of the object.

**Maximum force**  
Change the maximum joint force (in Newtons) of the object.

**Mouse button**  
Change the mouse button used to move the object.

**Start dragging object**  
Start dragging object.

### Behavior conditions

**Damping ratio**  
Compare the joint damping ratio (range: 0 to 1) of the object. .

**Frequency**  
Compare the joint frequency (per second) of the object.

**Automatic dragging**  
Check if automatic dragging is enabled.

**Is being dragged**  
Check if object is being dragged.

**Maximum force**  
Compare the maximum joint force (in Newtons) of the object.

**Mouse button**  
Compare the mouse button used to move the object.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.DraggablePhysics::Damping()` | Return the joint damping ratio (range: 0 to 1) of the object. . ||
| `Object.DraggablePhysics::Frequency()` | Return the joint frequency (per second) of the object. ||
| `Object.DraggablePhysics::MaxForce()` | Return the maximum joint force (in Newtons) of the object. ||
| `Object.DraggablePhysics::MouseButton()` | Return the mouse button used to move the object. ||
