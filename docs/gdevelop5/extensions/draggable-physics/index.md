Enables players to click and drag on physics objects to move them.  The object retains velocity when the click is released, allowing players to fling objects across the screen.

Note:

- The default "draggable" behavior will not work on objects with the physics behavior. This extension should be used instead.
- This extension will only work on objects that have the physics behavior.
- Kinematic physics mode is incompatible with this extension. The object will be changed to dynamic mode.

The Parking Jam example uses this extension ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://parking-jam)).
