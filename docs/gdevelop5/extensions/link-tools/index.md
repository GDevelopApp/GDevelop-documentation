This provides:

* "Can reach through links" conditions, useful to check if an object is linked to another through one or more other linked objects.
* a path finding movement behavior that uses objects links (instead of obstacles for the other behavior)

For instance, it can be helpful for grid-based games like:

* Match-3 ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://bim-bam))
* Tactical ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://tactical-game-grid-movement))
* City builders ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://city-builder))
* Point and click (bypass obstacles with a predetermined polygonal chain)
