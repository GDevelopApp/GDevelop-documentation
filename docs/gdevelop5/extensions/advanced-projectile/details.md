# Advanced Projectile

Control how a projectile moves including speed, acceleration, distance, and lifetime.

Tips:

- To simulate a rocket, use a starting speed of 0 and a positive acceleration (max speed may also be used)
- To simulate a hand grenade, use a high starting speed, a negative acceleration, and a non-zero lifetime
- If the object is not moving, acceleration will be towards the direction it is facing
- If the object is moving, acceleration will be in the direction the object is moving
