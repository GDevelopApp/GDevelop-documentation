# Advanced Projectile

Control how a projectile moves including speed, acceleration, distance, and lifetime.

## Simulate a rocket
A rocket can be simulated with:
- a starting speed of 0
- a positive acceleration

!!! tip
   A max speed may also be defined to avoid the projectile to go too fast.
- To simulate a hand grenade, use a high starting speed, a negative acceleration, and a non-zero lifetime
- If the object is not moving, acceleration will be towards the direction it is facing
- If the object is moving, acceleration will be in the direction the object is moving
