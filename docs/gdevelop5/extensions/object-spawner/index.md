## Object spawner 

Spawn (create) objects periodically. 

### Behavior actions

**Restart cool down**  
Restart the cool down of a spawner.

**Maximum quantity**  
Change the maximum number of living objects a spawner can create. Set it to 0 to never stop spawning objects.

**Offset on X axis**  
Change the offset X relative to origin of spawner (in pixels).

**Offset on Y axis**  
Change the offset Y relative to origin of spawner (in pixels).

**Spawn period**  
Change the spawn period (in seconds).

**Spawn objects periodically**  
Spawn (create) objects periodically. This action must be run every frame to work. When the max quantity is reached and an instance is deleted, the spawner waits the duration of the spawn period before creating another instance. Spawned objects are automatically linked to the spawner.

### Behavior conditions

**Spawned object **  
Check if an object has just been created by this spawner. Useful for triggering visual and sound effects.
