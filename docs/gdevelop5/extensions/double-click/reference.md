Allow you to check for double-clicks with the left, middle, or right button of a mouse. It will also allow you to detect double-taps on touchscreens. 

Please note: Touch devices do not have alternatives for middle/right clicks. Taps on a touch device will get counted for _any_ use of these conditions, so you should either design your controls accordingly, or build out separate events if the device has a touch screen.
