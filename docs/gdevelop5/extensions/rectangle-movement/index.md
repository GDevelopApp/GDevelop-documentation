Move objects in a rectangular pattern with easing functions from the Tween extension.

It can be used for:


- Moveable platforms
- Enemy movement patterns
- Moving along the border of another object

The platformer example uses this extension ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://platformer)).

This game shows how to make objects move around the border of another object ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://moving-saw-platformer)).

This example can be used to test different settings ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://rectangular-movement)).
