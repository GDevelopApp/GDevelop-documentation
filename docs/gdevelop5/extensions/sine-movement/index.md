Allow an object to move smoothly on the X and/or Y axis following a sine wave, or an ellipsis.


Example uses:

- Floating objects, such as powerups or coins
- Moveable platforms
- Enemy movement patterns

Properties:

- Horizontal distance
- Vertical distance
- Horizontal speed
- Vertical speed
- Center of movement, X position

Tips:

- For circular or elliptical movement, the horizontal and vertical speed need to be the same

- For vertical movement only, set horizontal distance to 0
- For figure-8 movement, set horizontal speed to 1/2 of the vertical speed
