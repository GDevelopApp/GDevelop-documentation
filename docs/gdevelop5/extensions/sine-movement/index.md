Allow an object to move smoothly on the X and/or Y axis following a sine wave, or an ellipsis.


Example uses:

- Floating objects, such as powerups or coins
- Moveable platforms
- Enemy movement patterns

Properties:

- Horizontal distance
- Vertical distance
- Horizontal speed
- Vertical speed
- Center of movement, X position
- Center of movement, Y position

Tips:

- For circular or elliptical movement, the horizontal and vertical speed need to be the same
- For horizontal movement only, set vertical distance to 0
- For vertical movement only, set horizontal distance to 0
- For figure-8 movement, set horizontal speed to 1/2 of the vertical speed

## Sine Movement 

Allow an object to move smoothly on the X and/or Y axis following a sine wave.

Example uses:
- Floating pickups
- Moveable platforms
- Enemy movement

Properties:
- Center of movement, X position
- Center of movement, Y position
- Horizontal distance
- Vertical distance
- Horizontal speed
- Horizontal distance

Tips:
- For circular or elliptical movement, the horizontal and vertical speed need to be the same
- For horizontal movement, set vertical distance to 0
- For vertical movement, set horizontal distance to 0
- For figure-8 movement, set horizontal speed to 1/2 of the vertical speed. 

### Behavior actions

**Reset sine progress counters**  
Reset sine progress counters. The object will return to the initial state.

**Set center X position**  
Set center X position.

**Set center Y position**  
Set center Y position.

**Set horizontal distance**  
Set horizontal distance.

**Set horizontal speed**  
Set horizontal speed.

**Set vertical distance**  
Set vertical distance.

**Set vertical speed**  
Set vertical speed.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.SineMovement::CenterX()` | Center of movement, X position. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::CenterY()` | Center of movement, Y position. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::HorizontalDistance()` | Horizontal distance. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::HorizontalSpeed()` | Horizontal speed. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::SineProgressX()` | Counter used to change the X position of the object. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::SineProgressY()` | Counter used to change the Y position of the object. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::VerticalDistance()` | Vertical distance. ||
| `Object.SineMovement::VerticalSpeed()` | Vertical speed. ||
