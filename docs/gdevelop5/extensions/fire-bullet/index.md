This extension allows objects to fire bullets.

It handles:

- Cooldown between shots
- Firing multiple bullets at a time ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://fire-bullet))
- Ammo management
- Overheat

It can be used for:

- Twin-stick shooters ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://conviction-of-gun-dude-desktop))
- Shoot'em up ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://space-shooter))

A simple example shows how to make firing patterns ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://firing-patterns)).

## Fire bullets 

Fire bullets, manage ammo, reloading, and overheating. 

### Behavior actions

**Fire bullets toward an angle**  
Fire bullets in the direction of a given angle.

**Fire bullets toward an object**  
Fire bullets toward an object.

**Fire bullets toward a position**  
Fire bullets toward a position.

**Increase ammo**  
Increase ammo quantity.

**Reload ammo**  
Reload ammo.

**Reset total bullets created**  
Reset total bullets created.

**Reset total reloads completed**  
Reset total reloads completed.

**Reset total shots fired**  
Reset total shots fired.

**Ammo quantity**  
Change the ammo quantity.

**Angle variance**  
Change the angle variance (in degrees) applied to each bullet.

**Enable (or disable) automatic reloading**  
Enable (or disable) automatic reloading.

**Set bullet layer**  
Change the layer that bullets are created on.

**Bullets per shot**  
Change the number of bullets shot every time the "fire bullet" action is used.

**Bullet speed variance**  
Change the bullet speed variance (pixels per second) applied to each bullet.

**Firing cooldown**  
Change the firing cooldown (in seconds) also known as rate of fire.

**Exponential cooling rate**  
Change the exponential cooling rate, per second.

**Firing arc**  
Change the firing arc (in degrees) where bullets are shot. Bullets are evenly spaced out inside the firing arc.

**Heat increase per shot**  
Change the heat increase per shot.

**Linear cooling rate**  
Change the linear cooling rate (per second).

**Max ammo**  
Change the max ammo.

**Overheat duration**  
Change the overheat duration (in seconds). When an object is overheated, it can't fire for this duration.

**Enable (or disable) bullet rotation**  
Enable bullet rotation.

**Shots per reload**  
Change the number of shots per reload.

**Enable (or disable) unlimited ammo**

### Behavior conditions

**Ammo quantity**  
Compare the ammo quantity.

**Angle variance**  
Compare the angle variance (in degrees) applied to each bullet.

**Bullets per shot**  
Compare the number of bullets shot every time the "fire bullet" action is used.

**Is bullet rotation enabled**  
Check if bullet rotates to match trajectory.

**Bullet speed variance**  
Compare the bullet speed variance (pixels per second) applied to each bullet.

**Firing cooldown**  
Compare the firing cooldown (in seconds) also known as rate of fire.

**Duration before cooldown end**  
Compare the remaining duration before the cooldown will permit a bullet to be fired, in seconds.

**Exponential cooling rate**  
Compare the exponential cooling rate, per second.

**Firing arc**  
Compare the firing arc (in degrees) where bullets are shot. Bullets are evenly spaced out inside the firing arc.

**Has just fired**  
Check if the object has just fired something.

**Heat increase per shot**  
Compare the heat increase per shot.

**Heat level**  
Compare the heat level (range: 0 to 1).

**Is automatic reloading enabled**  
Check if automatic reloading is enabled.

**Is firing cooldown active**  
Check if firing cooldown is active.

**Is out of ammo**  
Check if object has no ammo available.

**Is overheated**

**Linear cooling rate**  
Compare the linear cooling rate (per second).

**Max ammo**  
Compare the max ammo.

**Overheat duration**  
Compare the overheat duration (in seconds). When an object is overheated, it can't fire for this duration.

**Duration before overheat end**  
Compare the remaining duration before the overheat penalty ends, in seconds.

**Reload duration**  
Compare the reload duration (in seconds).

**Shots before next reload**  
Compare the remaining shots before the next reload is required.

**Shots per reload**  
Compare the number of shots per reload.
