Draw a shock wave animation that looks like an explosion and other visual effects.
Shock wave shape can be a circle or star pattern.

How to use:


- Assign behavior to a shape-painter object
- Create the shape-painter object where you want the shock wave to appear
- Shock wave animation will start automatically
- Shape-painter will delete itself after the animation is finished

Tips:


- Appearance of the shock wave can be changed by editing the behavior properties
- Properties can be edited in the scene editor or by using actions after the shape-painter object is created
