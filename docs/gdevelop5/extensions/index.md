# Extensions

GDevelop is built in a flexible way. In addition to [core features](/gdevelop5/all-features), new capabilities are provided by extensions. Extensions can contain objects, behaviors, actions, conditions, expressions or events.

[Directly from GDevelop](/gdevelop5/extensions/search), you have access to a collection of community created extensions, listed here. You can also [create](/gdevelop5/extensions/create), directly in your project, new behaviors, actions, conditions or expressions for your game.
