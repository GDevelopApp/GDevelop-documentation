This behavior tracks the object position and provides a condition to check if the object has been around the same position for a certain amount of time. It's useful to track objects that are not moving (or very little, at least staying around a position).

To use:

* Add the behavior to your object.
* Configure the distance tolerance and the amount of time before considering objects idle.
* Use the conditions in your events to know when the object is idle (or when it has just moved).
