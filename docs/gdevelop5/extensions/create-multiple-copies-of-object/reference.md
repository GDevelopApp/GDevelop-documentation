This extension can be used to create multiple copies of an object in a wide variety of arrangements, including:

- horizontal row(s)
- vertical column(s)
- a solid rectangle or square
- an evenly spaced grid
- a grid with different spacing between rows and columns

After the objects are created, you can reference their object variables to manage the objects:


* `RowID`:  what horizontal row does this object reside in,
* `ColumnID`:  what vertical column does this object reside in,
* `CreationID`:  starting top-left, and proceeding from left to right, what is the number of the created object,
* `BatchID`:  optional identifier assigned to all objects created
