!!! tip

    This pack also contains [sliders](/gdevelop5/objects/slider).

####  Create a toggle switch from scratch 

Toggle switches need one image for each state: checked or unchecked.

!!! tip

    The states transition can be animated. It works the same way as [Sprites](/gdevelop5/objects/sprite).

Toggle switch states can be checked with the "Is checked" condition.

Sliders and toggle switches can be useful to make a settings panel. As the settings panel and the game may be in different scene, the value can be stored in a global variable to be able use it in the game scene.
