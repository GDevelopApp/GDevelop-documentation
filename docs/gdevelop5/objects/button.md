####  Get a button from asset store 

The [Buttons asset pack](https://gdevelop.io/asset-store/free/menu-buttons-menu-buttons) from the asset store contains free and read-to-use buttons.

####  Create a button from scratch 

Buttons need 3 images, one for each state:

- Idle
- Hovered
- Pressed

The object automatically shows the right image according to taps on a touchscreen or the mouse cursor.

!!! tip

    The same image can be used for the 3 states. The button won't be animated but it will still work.

###  Handle button clicks 

Button clicks/taps can be checked with a condition.

###  Customize buttons when their state change 

Button states can be checked with conditions. For instance, it allows to apply [an effect](/gdevelop5/objects/effects) to make a button appear brighter when it's pressed.
