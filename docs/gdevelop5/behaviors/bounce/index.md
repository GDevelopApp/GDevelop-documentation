# Bounce Behavior

GDevelop makes it easy to simulate real bouncing in a game. _Bounce behavior_ can be applied to any object that may be involved in a collision. Because the [behavior](/gdevelop5/behaviors) considers the angle and speed of forces applied to the [object](/gdevelop5/objects), the bounce response will feel realistic to the player.

## What's the logic behind the behavior?

!!! tip

    The behavior looks at the object's position and velocity at the time of the collision. It adds a force in the direction of the normal vector between the collided object and the object, and then adds the difference between the normal vector and the previous angle of movement.
