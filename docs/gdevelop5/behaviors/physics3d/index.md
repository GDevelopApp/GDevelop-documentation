# 3D Physics Engine

GDevelop provides a powerful 3D Physics Engine, allowing to create any kind of 3D games.

!!! tip 

    The 3D physics engine is powered by Jolt Physics a **modern, performant, battle-tested, fully featured** 3D physics engine used in AAA games, like Horizon: Forbidden West. It's perfect for making FPS, TPS, 3D platformers and in the future 3D racing games or any 3D game.

The 3D Physics Engine is available through:

* A behavior **"3D physics"** to apply 3D objects. For example, add the behavior to platforms, with the type set to "Static" in the behavior property so they don't move.
  You can choose the collider shape: box, sphere, cylinder or capsule and modify physics properties of the objects having this behavior - much like the 2D physics engine.
* A behavior for 3D characters: a dedicated **"3D Physics Character"** behavior is available.
* For the player character, pair the 3D Physics Character behavior with **one or more additional behaviors** to get controls working out of the box: "3D Shooter keyboard mapper", "3D Platformer keyboard mapper", etc... Behaviors with support for touch screens, gamepads and keyboard/mouse have all been made and tested.

## How to set up 3D Physics for obstacles in a new game

This section is being written and will be available soon.

## How to set up a 3D character with controls

This section is being written and will be available soon.

## Concepts used in Physics

This section is being written and will be available soon.
In the meantime, you can refer to the descriptions for the [2D Physics Engine](/gdevelop5/behaviors/physics2/) as most concepts are the same.

## Reference

All actions, conditions and expressions are listed in the [3D Physics reference page](/gdevelop5/all-features/physics3d/reference/).
