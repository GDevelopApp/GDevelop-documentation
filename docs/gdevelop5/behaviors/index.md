# Behaviors

In GDevelop, _behaviors_ add significant features to [objects](/gdevelop5/objects) in a matter of clicks.

For example, behaviors can:

* Automatically remove objects from a scene when they move outside the edges of the screen.
* Make objects move in a realistic way by following the laws of physics.
* Allow players to move an object with the arrow keys.

You can also customize behaviors to make your game feel unique and use [events](/gdevelop5/events) to manipulate behaviors.
