Check if all sub conditions are true

**Compare two numbers**  
Compare the two numbers.

**Compare two strings**  
Compare the two strings.

**Not**

**Trigger once while true**  
Run actions only once, for each time the conditions have been met.

**Or**  
Check if one of the sub conditions is true
