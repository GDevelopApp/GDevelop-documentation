# Making sound effects using jfxr

GDevelop comes bundled with a sound effect creator called [jfxr](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/). Which can be used to make sound effects right inside GDevelop.

    jfxr is currently only bundled with the desktop version. You won't be able to use it with the online editor.

# Opening jfxr

You can use jfxr instead of inputting a sound file (.wav, etc..) by clicking **Create** given near the parameter

Once you click save and exit, the sound file should be added to the action parameter. You can use the sound you created as normal in the events.

    It might give an error saying that the file does not exist. Just reopen the action editor and it should be fixed

You can also save the sounds as a ".jfxr" file using **Save**. Which you can open later and continue working on by opening it with **Open**. You can also export the sound externally using **Export**. You can even generate a link to your sound.
