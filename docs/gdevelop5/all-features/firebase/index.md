# Firebase

To get started using Firebase, see how to set it up in [quickstart](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/quickstart).

!!! warning

    You must be familiar with GDevelop [Variable Callbacks](/gdevelop5/events/callback-variables) to use this extension, as there is a heavy usage of those.

Firebase is a set of free services for developers: analytics, authentication of users, storage... While most of the services are free, some might require you to pay a Firebase subscription if you're using them a lot or over the free quota.

The services includes:

  * [Analytics](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/analytics)
  * [Remote configuration](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/rc)
  * [Authentication](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/authentication)
  * [A document oriented database (Cloud Firestore Database)](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/firestore)
  * [An online filesystem (Firebase Storage)](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/storage)
  * [Firebase functions](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/functions) (requires JavaScript knowledge)
  * [Remote performance measuring](/gdevelop5/all-features/firebase/perfomance)
