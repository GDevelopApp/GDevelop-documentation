# Firebase Storage

!!! note

    GDevelop not supporting binary data (Files/Blobs) as Variable type (yet?), support for this feature is very poor.

Currently, there is not much that you can do with storage.
You can get the download URL of an online file and let the user download it, which can be useful for example for hosting and downloading updates.
!!! tip

    You can also combine it with [the load image from url](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://load-image-from-url) example.
