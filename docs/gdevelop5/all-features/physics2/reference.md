# Physics Engine 2.0

The physics engine simulates realistic object physics, with gravity, forces, joints, etc. It's perfect for games that need to have realistic behaving objects and a gameplay centered around it. [Read more explanations about it.](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/behaviors/physics2)

## Actions

**World time scale**  
Modify the world time scale. While an object is needed, this will apply to all objects using the behavior.

## Conditions

**Collision**  
Check if two objects collide.

**Collision started**  
Check if two objects just started colliding during this frame.

**Collision stopped**  
Check if two objects just stopped colliding at this frame.



## Physics Engine 2.0 

Simulate realistic object physics with gravity, forces, joints, etc. 

### Behavior actions

**Add distance joint**  
Add a distance joint between two objects. The length is converted to meters using the world scale on X. The frequency and damping ratio are related to the joint speed of oscillation and how fast it stops.

**Add friction joint**  
Add a friction joint between two objects.

**Add gear joint**  
Add a gear joint between two joints. Attention: Gear joints require the joints to be revolute or prismatic, and both of them to be attached to a static body as first object.

**Add motor joint**  
Add a motor joint between two objects. The position and angle offsets are relative to the first object.

**Add mouse joint**  
Add a mouse joint to an object (makes the object move towards a specific point).

**Add prismatic joint**  
Add a prismatic joint between two objects. The translation limits are converted to meters using the world scale on X.

**Add pulley joint**  
Add a pulley joint between two objects. Lengths are converted to meters using the world scale on X.

**Add revolute joint**  
Add a revolute joint to an object at a fixed point. The object is attached as the second object in the joint, so you can use this for gear joints.

**Add revolute joint between two bodies**  
Add a revolute joint between two objects. The reference angle determines what is considered as the base angle at the initial state.

**Add rope joint**  
Add a rope joint between two objects. The maximum length is converted to meters using the world scale on X.

**Add weld joint**  
Add a weld joint between two objects.
