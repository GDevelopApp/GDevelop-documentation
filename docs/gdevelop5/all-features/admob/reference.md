Allow to display AdMob banners, app open, interstitials, rewarded interstitials and rewarded video ads. [Read more explanations about it.](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/all-features/admob)

## Actions

Mark the rewarded video reward as claimed. Useful if you used the condition to check if the reward was given to the user without clearing the reward.

**Hide banner**  
Hide the banner. You can show it again with the corresponding action.

**Load app open**  
Start loading an app open (that can be displayed automatically when the loading is finished).  
If test mode is set, a test app open will be displayed.

**Load rewarded interstitial**  
Start loading a rewarded interstitial (that can be displayed automatically when the loading is finished).

**Enable test mode**  
Activate or deactivate the test mode ("development" mode).  
When activated, tests ads will be served instead of real ones.

It is important to enable test ads during development so that you can click on them without charging advertisers. If you click on too many ads without being in test mode, you risk your account being flagged for invalid activity.

**Configure the banner**  
Configure a banner, which can then be displayed.

Once a banner is positioned (at the top or bottom of the game), it can't be moved anymore.
