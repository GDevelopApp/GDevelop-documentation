# Creating new themes for GDevelop

Install the development version of GDevelop and read [this documentation page](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README-themes.md) to know how to create a new theme and customize it.

Once you're done, feel free to submit a **Pull Request on GitHub** to get your theme added to the next version of GDevelop.
