# Spatial sound Reference

Allow positioning sounds in a 3D space. The stereo system of the device is used to simulate the position of the sound and to give the impression that the sound is located somewhere around the player. 

## Actions

**Listener position**  
Change the spatial position of the listener/player.

**Set position of sound**  
Sets the spatial position of a sound. When a sound is at a distance of 1 to the listener, it's heard at 100% volume. Then, it follows an *inverse distance model*. At a distance of 2, it's heard at 50%, and at a distance of 4 it's heard at 25%.

The Spatial sound extension is always installed in all GDevelop projects: there is no need to add it from the Project Manager.
