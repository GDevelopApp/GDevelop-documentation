# File system

Access the filesystem of the operating system. [Read more explanations about it.](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/all-features/filesystem)

## Actions

**Delete a file**  
Delete a file from the filesystem.

**Delete a file (Async)**  
Delete a file from the filesystem asynchronously. The option result variable will be updated once the file is deleted.

**Load a text from a file (Async)**  
Load a text from a file, asynchronously. Use this for large files to avoid any lag or freeze during game execution. The content of the file will be available in the scene variable after a small delay (usually a few milliseconds). The 'result' variable gets updated when the operation has finished.

**Load a text from a file**  
Load a text from a file. Only use this on small files to avoid any lag or freeze during the game execution.

**Load a scene variable from a JSON file (Async)**  
Load a JSON formatted text from a file and convert it to a scene variable (potentially a structure variable with children), asynchronously. Use this for large files to avoid any lag or freeze during game execution. The content of the file will be available as a scene variable after a small delay (usually a few milliseconds). The 'result' variable gets updated when the operation has finished.

**Load a scene variable from a JSON file**  
Load a JSON formatted text from a file and convert it to a scene variable (potentially a structure variable with children). Only use this on small files to avoid any lag or freeze during the game execution.

**Create a directory**  
Create a new directory at the specified path.

**Save a text into a file (Async)**  
Save a text into a file asynchronously. Use this for large files to avoid any lag or freeze during game execution. The 'result' variable gets updated when the operation has finished.

**Save a text into a file**  
Save a text into a file. Only use this on small files to avoid any lag or freeze during the game execution.

**Save a scene variable into a JSON file (Async)**  
Save the scene variable (including, for structures, all the children) into a file in JSON format, asynchronously. Use this for large files to avoid any lag or freeze during game execution. The 'result' variable gets updated when the operation has finished.

**Save a scene variable into a JSON file**  
Save a scene variable (including, for structure, all the children) into a file in JSON format. Only use this on small files to avoid any lag or freeze during the game execution.

## Conditions

**File or directory exists**  
Check if the file or directory exists.
