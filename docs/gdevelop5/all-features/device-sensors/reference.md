# Device sensors

Allow the game to access the sensors of a mobile device. [Read more explanations about it.](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/all-features/device-sensors)

## Actions

**Activate motion sensor**  
Activate the motion sensor. (remember to turn it off again)

**Activate orientation sensor**  
Activate the orientation sensor. (remember to turn it off again)

**Deactivate motion sensor**  
Deactivate the motion sensor.

**Deactivate orientation sensor**  
Deactivate the orientation sensor.

## Conditions

**Compare the value of acceleration on X-axis**  
Compare the value of acceleration on the X-axis (m/s²).

**Compare the value of acceleration on Y-axis**  
Compare the value of acceleration on the Y-axis (m/s²).

**Compare the value of acceleration on Z-axis**  
Compare the value of acceleration on the Z-axis (m/s²).

**Sensor active**  
The condition is true if the device motion sensor is currently active

**Compare the value of orientation alpha**  
Compare the value of orientation alpha. (Range: 0 to 360°)

**Compare the value of orientation beta**  
Compare the value of orientation beta. (Range: -180 to 180°)

**Compare the value of orientation gamma**  
Compare the value of orientation gamma. (Range: -90 to 90°)

**Sensor active**  
The condition is true if the device orientation sensor is currently active

**Compare the value of rotation alpha**  
Compare the value of rotation alpha. (Note: few devices support this sensor)

**Compare the value of rotation beta**  
Compare the value of rotation beta. (Note: few devices support this sensor)

**Compare the value of rotation gamma**  
Compare the value of rotation gamma. (Note: few devices support this sensor)
