# Objects

Common features that can be used for all objects in GDevelop. [Read more explanations about it.](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/objects/base_object/events)

## Actions

**Pick a random object**  
Pick one object from all the specified objects. When an object is picked, the next conditions and actions of this event work only on that object.

**Pick all instances**  
Pick all instances of the specified object(s). When you pick all instances, the next conditions and actions of this event work on all of them.

**Create an object**  
Create an object at specified position

**Create an object from its name**  
Among the objects of the specified group, this action will create the object with the specified name.

**Apply movement to all objects**  
Moves all objects according to the forces they have. GDevelop calls this action at the end of the events by default.

## Conditions

**Pick a random object**  
Pick one object from all the specified objects. When an object is picked, the next conditions and actions of this event work only on that object.

**Pick all objects**  
Pick all the specified objects. When you pick all objects, the next conditions and actions of this event work on all of them.

**Collision**  
Test the collision between two objects using their collision masks.

**Distance between two objects**  
Compare the distance between two objects.  
If condition is inverted, only objects that have a distance greater than specified to any other object will be picked.

**An object is turned toward another**  
Check if an object is turned toward another

**Pick nearest object**  
Pick the object of this type that is nearest to the specified position. If the condition is inverted, the object farthest from the specified position is picked instead.

**Number of object instances currently picked**  
Compare the number of instances picked by the previous conditions (or actions).

**Raycast**  
Sends a ray from the given source position and angle, intersecting the closest object.  
The instersected object will become the only one taken into account.
If the condition is inverted, the object to be intersected will be the farthest one within the ray radius.

**Raycast to position**  
Sends a ray from the given source position to the final point, intersecting the closest object.  
The instersected object will become the only one taken into account.
If the condition is inverted, the object to be intersected will be the farthest one within the ray radius.

**Number of object instances on the scene**  
Compare the number of instances of the specified objects living on the scene.

**An object is moving toward another (using forces)**  
Check if an object moves toward another.  
The first object must move.

**The cursor/touch is on an object**  
Test if the cursor is over an object, or if the object is being touched.
