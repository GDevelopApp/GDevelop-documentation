## Creating a private web link

Using GDevelop hosting servers, you can export your game for publication on the web. These servers are backed by Amazon's robust services. Sharing your game this way is free, and your game will be available through this link indefinitely!

First make sure you have logged in within GDevelop. To upload to the servers click the publish button in the upper middle section of your screen, and in the exports window click "generate link".

When your link is generated, you'll see it on screen. You can copy and paste this link and share it with people you'd like to play your game. To copy it to your clipboard, click on the clipboard icon that is highlighted in the image below.

This link is currently private, only those you share the link with will be able to play your game.
