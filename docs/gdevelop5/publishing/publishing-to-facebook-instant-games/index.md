# Publish your game to Messenger with Facebook Instant Games

Facebook Instant games are games that you can play with your friends on Facebook Messenger. And Facebook allows games which are exported from GDevelop to be published into the Facebook instant games using the following steps.

### 1) Create an account and an app on Facebook Developers

Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and login to your Facebook account. Once you have logged in to your account, hover over **My Apps** and click **Create New App**.

!!! note

    It's important to do this *even if you don't want to publish the game* yet! If you don't have a version marked with the star as ready for production, you won't be able to test your game.

#### (Optional) Add testers

To let your friends or coworkers test the game, add them as testers. In the left menu, click on Roles:

Click then on **Add testers** button and add your friends/coworkers.

### 3) Test your game!

On your phone, open Facebook Messenger. Go to a conversation, click on the **+** button and choose **Games**:

*Your game is starting!* If for some reason you can't see your game, make sure that you've properly filled the information and sent the zip file on Facebook Developers. Make sure that the phone you're using is connected with your Facebook account or the one of a tester.

### 4) Send your game to review and publish it

Send new versions of your game until you're happy with it. Make sure to fill all the information and to add high quality images. Once you're ready, click on the **Review** menu to send your game to be reviewed by Facebook.
