## Uploading the Game

[![](/gdevelop5/publishing/gamejolt_logo.png)](https://gamejolt.com/join) Head over to the Game Jolt website and **Register** yourself if you haven't already. It should be a straightforward process. You need to be a registered user for uploading your games on Game Jolt.

Game Jolt supports these types of game packages for a browser based game: `HTML5`, `Flash`, `Unity`, `Java Applet` and `Silverlight`.

After you have registered yourself, you can now upload and publish your game. Click on your Profile at the top-right corner and click on the `Add a Game` button.

On the next page, you will need to choose the stage of development of your game. You can change it anytime. Let's go with the **Complete/Stable** option since we already have a ready-to-play HTML5 package for our game.

The next page requires you to fill in the details for your game like its name, URL-slug, game website, etc. You can get your desired URL by typing it into the field as long as it's available. A website can also be supplied if you have one.

This is the page where you will be handling your game releases. To add your first package, scroll down and click on the `New Release` button.

Two options, namely, `Upload Downloadable Build` and `Upload Browser Build`, will be available here. The downloadable build is for distributing executable files that can run on the system. Since you want your game to be playable in the browser, click on `Browse` under the `Upload Browser Build` option and select the `.zip` HTML5 package that you had created before.
