  * **[Mobile](/gdevelop5/publishing/android_and_ios):** this prepares your game for Android (and iOS support is coming soon). It builds it online, using GDevelop online services. Then sends you a link so that you can install it on Android and [publish it to the Play Store](/gdevelop5/publishing/android_and_ios/play-store) (or App Store later for iOS) or on the [Amazon App Store](/gdevelop5/publishing/publishing-to-amazon-app-store).
