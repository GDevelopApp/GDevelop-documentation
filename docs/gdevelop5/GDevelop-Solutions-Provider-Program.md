## Applying as a GDevelop Professional

Professionals interested in becoming part of the GDevelop Solution Partner Program can apply online through a form.
The validation process is as follows:

1. The candidate fills the online form with their professional profile
2. The GDevelop team will look at the application and contact the candidate if more information is needed
3. A possible video call between a GDevelop member and the candidate might be required to better seize the profile's specialization.
4. If the profile is validated, the professional will join GDevelop's channels where they'll be able to see the projects hiring.

**Once a GDevelop Professional stablishes contact with a Client, the GDevelop team leaves the process. From that moment the Professional and the Client remain responsible for the Project's management, delivery and billing process.
