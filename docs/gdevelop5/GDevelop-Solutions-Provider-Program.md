## How It Works
The program functions on a dual basis:

This ensures access to skillful experts capable of optimizing user interactions, finding an engaging storyline concept, and executing efficient technical solutions.

## Applying as a GDevelop Professional

Professionals interested in becoming part of the GDevelop Solutions Provider Program can apply online through a form.
The validation process is as follows:

1. The candidate fills the online form with their professional profile
2. The GDevelop team will look at the application and contact the candidate if more information is needed
3. A video call with a GDevelop team member might be required to better understand the candidate's specialization.
4. If the profile is validated, the professional will join GDevelop's channels where they'll be able to see the projects hiring.

**Once a GDevelop Professional establishes contact with a Client, the GDevelop team steps out of the process. From that moment on, the Professional and the Client remain responsible for the project's management, delivery, and billing.
GDevelop **does not** take any cut or percentage for head hunting during 2023 and 2024.*
