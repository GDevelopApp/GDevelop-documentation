# Selling assets on GDevelop's Asset Store

GDevelop has its own built-in asset store, allowing game creators to access game art and game templates directly within the app.
By providing easy-to-use and high-quality assets, we're enabling creators to get a head start on their video game creation journey.

## In short

You will be required to:

1. Agree to revenue sharing.
2. Choose for your pack: a title, a description, a price (free or paid), and a license.
3. Produce a cover image in 16:9 format.
4. Produce between 1 and 10 images (or audio) representing the content of the pack.
5. Integrate your assets into a GDevelop project and export a '.gdo' file.
6. Send us your files.

Read on to learn more about revenue sharing, transactions, and other agreements to know before becoming a seller.

## Revenue sharing

When an asset is sold on GDevelop's Asset Store, the purchase is distributed as follows: 40% for the Asset creator, 33% for GDevelop, and 27% for government taxes (VAT) and payment provider fees.

Note that:

- The VAT and payment providers' fees might amount to something larger than 27%. In this case, **you still keep 40%**, and it's us, GDevelop, who will have our margin reduced.
- A cut of 33% might sound a bit higher than some other stores - but other stores express their percentage without mentioning VAT. So the real percentage you are earning is less than what they advertise. For example, if a store says they take 30%, it does not include the VAT and payment process fee, so you will earn way less than 70% (probably something between 25% and 45% of the total price after VAT and additional fees).
- An interesting feature of the GDevelop asset store is that it gives **ready-to-use objects** for creators' games. This means the value someone gets when buying an asset in GDevelop is higher: they receive something we prepared as an object ready to be used (no manual work is involved).

!!! note

    Earnings from GDevelop paying services (including [premium licenses](https://gdevelop.io/pricing)) are reinvested in internet hosting fees, engine development, product research, and feature development.

## The pricing

It contains 2 types of pricing:

- **Free**: These assets are accessible to anyone, royalty-free, and open for any type of modification.
- **Paid**: These assets are of higher quality and are carefully selected by the GDevelop team for a more unique game style.

Getting a good price for your work is important. A lower price means your percentage of revenue will be lower, while a higher price might mean your work won't sell well. See the prices in the store to get an idea of the current pricing.
Nevertheless, if the GDevelop team thinks that the price of a creator is either too high or too low compared to the average price on the Asset Store, we will reach out to you to let you know the price must be adjusted.

!!! note

    Please note that if you would like to change the price of the pack afterward, you will have to get in touch with us.

## The license(s)

Licenses are complex. To keep it simple, if you're not sure what to choose, we suggest these:

- **Free**: [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) or [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- **Paid**: You are agreeing to this final license for the end-user buying your assets: [Asset Store License Agreement](https://gdevelop.io/page/asset-store-license-agreement)

!!! warning

    You have to own the rights to your assets. If an asset is flagged for infringing copyright after being accepted and uploaded to the store, we reserve the right to remove the entire pack or the asset and cancel all purchases that have been processed for it.

## Transaction Management

GDevelop uses Stripe's Marketplace to handle payments.
To be eligible to sell Asset Packs on the app, you'll need:

- To be older than 13 years old.
- A valid email address.
- An address in your country of residence.
- A bank account in your country of residence.

Once your assets have been accepted, GDevelop's team will create a Stripe account for you.
You will have to complete your registration with your email address, home address, full name, and bank details. Once you've filled in this information, your Stripe account will be up and running with a purchases dashboard, where you'll be able to follow all your transactions.
Payments to your bank account can be scheduled directly on Stripe to happen on a daily basis.

!!! warning

    According to [Stripe's terms and conditions](https://support.stripe.com/questions/age-requirement-to-create-a-stripe-account), users under 18 years old will need the permission of a legal tutor to withdraw their earnings.

## Invoices management

GDevelop's Asset Store is built as a marketplace: GDevelop hosts a digital solution that allows users to sell their products (sellers) to users that would like to use them in their projects (buyers).

Here is what happens when a buyer purchases a product on the asset store:

- GDevelop buys the product from the seller.
- GDevelop resells it to the buyer.

From the accounting point of view, the seller should create an invoice addressed to GDevelop.
To avoid obliging sellers to create such invoices, GDevelop will create self-billing invoices that you will be able to retrieve.

As a seller, by selling your products on GDevelop's Asset Store, you accept that GDevelop creates self-billing invoices for each purchase of your products.

## Asset Pack storage and safety

All Asset Packs are safely stored on GDevelop's cloud.
This way, we ensure that the files are available for instant purchase and in-app use.

## Submitting your assets

First and foremost, we want to ensure the Asset Store remains a place of high quality and safe for everyone's use. Assets must be fully functional within the game engine to be eligible for the Asset Store. Two types are distinct; follow the guide that interests you:
