If you have too many files, you can manually package an asset pack without the game engine editor.

Here is an example for an imaginary `French food` asset pack:

```
French food

â”œâ”€â”€ pack.json                                 << Asset pack metadata

```

`TAGS.md` files can be used in folders to add additional tags that could describes the assets if the words aren't already in the folder name or the asset name.

### Sprite

You can put them in a folder of your choice. You Still have to make sure to follow the [naming best practices](/gdevelop5/community/contribute-to-the-assets-store#follow-naming-best-practices).

#### Static sprite

For unanimated [Sprites](/gdevelop5/objects/sprite), a single image with the name of the object is enough.

`Chair.png`

#### Sprites with animations or states

For animated sprites require multiple animated frames, which have to be named properly. While writing your file names, it is important that you follow a specific naming structure:

`BaseName_AnimationState_frame#.png`

### Tiled Sprite

### Panel Sprite

### 3D Box

### 3D models

Supported 3D file formats are:

- .glb
- .blend
- .gltf
- .obj
- .fbx
- .x3d
- .vrml

**Animation names** should be meaningful such as `run`, `jump`, `idle`, etc.

**Dimensions** of 3d models must be consistent across a pack. For instance, props should fit characters hands.

**The point of origin** is important, it will be used as the position and rotation center of object in GDevelop.

**Textures** are supported only in format types that are contained, such as `.glb`, `.blend`, `.fbx`.

!!! note

    There's no need to add images preview for the models, the asset store will automatically generate them.

### Tile map

[Tile map](/gdevelop5/objects/tilemap) are not yet supported for manual packaging. It must be integrated and configured in GDevelop then exported as `.gdo` by a right-click on the object.

### Fonts

Put the fonts in to a `Font` folders.
Formats supported are:

- .ttf
- .otf

### Audio, sound, music

Put your audio files `.aac`, `.wav`, `.mp3` (prefer `.aac`) directly in a `Audio` folder, with the name to be displayed: `Laser effect.aac`, `Background music.aac`.

!!! warning

        ðŸš¨ Careful about the size! Players are sensitive to the size of a game download (especially on mobile and on the web). **Try to keep music file sizes around 1 to 2 MB.  In rare cases, these can be 4 or 5 MB, but not larger.** Consider downgrading the quality a bit to keep the music files around these sizes.
    Sound effects are usually even smaller. If a sound file is larger than 200 or 300 KB, consider downgrading the quality.

A great tool to convert audio files to AAC format is [fre:ac](https://www.freac.org/). fre:ac is free, open-source, and cross-platform. It can process batches of files, with many options on how they are named and put into folders.

- Choose the encoder called "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Encoder".
- Select "File format > AAC"
- Select "Quality > Set Quality > 3"

This will create high-quality audio files, but using a variable bit rate that won't exceed 96 kbps (assuming stereo input).

### Spine

[Spine](/gdevelop5/objects/spine) are not yet supported for manual packaging. It must be integrated and configured in GDevelop then exported as `.gdo` by a right-click on the object.

### Custom objects

[Custom object (prefab)](/gdevelop5/objects/custom-objects-prefab-template/) with and without variant(s) are not yet supported for manual packaging. It must be integrated and configured in GDevelop then exported as `.gdo` by a right-click on the object.

### 2D & 3D Particules emitter

3D and [2D particle emitter](/gdevelop5/objects/particles_emitter/) with and without variant(s) are not yet supported for manual packaging. It must be integrated and configured in GDevelop then exported as `.gdo` by a right-click on the object.
