If you have too many files, you can manually package an asset pack without the game engine editor.

Here is an example for an imaginary `French food` asset pack:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ pack.json                                 << Asset pack metadata

```

`TAGS.md` files can be used in folders to add additional tags that could describes the assets if the words aren't already in the folder name or the asset name.



## Package fonts

Put the fonts in to a `Font` folders.
Formats supported are:

- .ttf
- .otf

### Static

You can put them in a folder of your choice. You Still have to make sure to follow the [naming best practices](/gdevelop5/community/contribute-to-the-assets-store#follow-naming-best-practices).

### Sprites with animations or states

Images that represent a same object at different states should be in the same [Sprite](/gdevelop5/objects/sprite) object as animations.

!!! tip

    Frames of all animations of an object can be imported at once by selecting several files. The editor will detect animation names automatically.

Each state (called **Animation** in the editor) can be animated or not.

Some instances of states:

- Empty or Filled
- Close or Open
- Locked or Unlocked
- On or Off

If your pack contains color variations of the same, it's recommended to create an object for each one.

Collections of images like playing cards should be merged into one object that contains an animation for each card.

## Package 3D models

Supported 3D file formats are:

- .glb
- .blend
- .gltf
- .obj
- .fbx
- .x3d
- .vrml

**Animation names** should be meaningful such as `run`, `jump`, `idle`, etc.

**Dimensions** of 3d models must be consistent across a pack. For instance, props should fit characters hands.

**The point of origin** is important, it will be used as the position and rotation center of object in GDevelop.

**Textures** are supported only in format types that are contained, such as `.glb`, `.blend`, `.fbx`.

!!! note

    There's no need to add images preview for the models, the asset store will automatically generate them.

## Tile maps

[Tile map](/gdevelop5/objects/tilemap) are not supported by the asset store.

## Package audio

Put your audio files `.aac`, `.wav`, `.mp3` (prefer `.aac`) directly in a `Audio` folder, with the name to be displayed: `Laser effect.aac`, `Background music.aac`.

!!! warning

        ðŸš¨ Careful about the size! Players are sensitive to the size of a game download (especially on mobile and on the web). **Try to keep music file sizes around 1 to 2 MB.  In rare cases, these can be 4 or 5 MB, but not larger.** Consider downgrading the quality a bit to keep the music files around these sizes.
    Sound effects are usually even smaller. If a sound file is larger than 200 or 300 KB, consider downgrading the quality.

A great tool to convert audio files to AAC format is [fre:ac](https://www.freac.org/). fre:ac is free, open-source, and cross-platform. It can process batches of files, with many options on how they are named and put into folders.

- Choose the encoder called "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Encoder".
- Select "File format > AAC"
- Select "Quality > Set Quality > 3"

This will create high-quality audio files, but using a variable bit rate that won't exceed 96 kbps (assuming stereo input).

!!! tip

        **How to submit my sounds and music when they are ready?**

    Zip the folder containing them and send them to the GDevelop team on Github by opening an [issue here](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%93%A6+Asset+Store+submission&template=--asset-store-submission.md&title=).

## Tiled images

Images that can be used as a pattern should be [Tiled sprites](/gdevelop5/objects/tiled_sprite).

## 9-patches

[Panel Sprite ("9-patch")](/gdevelop5/objects/panel_sprite) is an object where its image is split into 9 pieces or slices and each slice is scaled separately.

Corners should be fit as precisely as possible. This allows to use smaller objects size (where the center reaches 0 pixel).

## License

Put a license.txt file in your folder. Make sure to put your name in this license file too (or the name of the original author).
The importer will be adapted to understand the license file.

!!! danger

    Free asset packs with unclear licenses won't be accepted. In this case, you should get in touch with the author for clarifications and ask if they allow redistribution of their assets. The license must:

    - Allow to Use the assets for free and for any purpose
    - Allow modifications or derived work
    - State if attribution is required or not
