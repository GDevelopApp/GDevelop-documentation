# GSoC Contributor Guidance

Thanks for considering **GDevelop** for this GSoC edition!

Here is a **suggested** structure for your proposal:

  - A title and quick explanation about the idea you want to work on in a few sentences.
  - A larger description, that includes the main points of what you'd like to make/improve/fix (you can include an estimation of time if you have one).
  - If you identify risks or unknowns, be sure to include them. You can also list quick wins!
  - If there are any [cards on the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/qf0lM7k8/gdevelop-roadmap) that are part of your proposal, list them in your description.
  - A few words about you, if you want to.
  - Your favorite video game :) (or, if it's too hard to choose, you can choose 2!)

!!! tip

    A good proposal will show that you understood at least the big principles and are able to dive more in the problem.
