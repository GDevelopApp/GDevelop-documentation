## Games list

The Games section allows you to access, edit, manage, filter, and create your games. GDevelop automatically organizes multiple project versions (including local and cloud projects) under their respective games, simplifying version control and project iteration.

Each project attached to a game can be individually modified or, for cloud projects, shared with collaborators (see [project collaboration](/gdevelop5/collaboration/)).

#### Game cards

Each Game Card provides key details and indicators:

1. **Last Modification Details:** Displays who last modified the game and when. Learn more about [project collaboration](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/collaboration/).
2. **Number of projects (desktop or cloud) attached:** Shows the number of linked desktop or cloud projects. Click the icon to view all projects.
3. **gd.games published status (on/off):** Manages gameâ€™s visibility on gd.games. [Manage Game visibility](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/#manage-games-dashboard).

For published games, additional options are available:

!!! tip

    If a game isn't properly displaying a project, make sure that the project of the game still exists in your local files or in the cloud. Then, open the project so GDevelop recognizes it and links it to the game to which it belongs.

## Game earnings and GDevelop credits wallet

Each account on GDevelop can earn optionally earn from games published on gd.games. Creators have two options to cash out their game earnings:

 * Cash Out Directly: accumulate $60 USD of earnings to be able to cash them out.

To learn more about enabling game earnings, head to [Hosting on GDevelop's Platform](/gdevelop5/monetization/#hosting-on-gdevelops-platform-gdgames).

The Wallet section shows the credits in your GDevelop account. Use credits to buy on the GDevelop Asset Store (asset packs, templates, premium courses...). A few ways to get credits are listed below:

* Giving [written feedback](/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/player-feedback/#giving-feedback) on games published on gd.games.
