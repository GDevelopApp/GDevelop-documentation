# Check for Updates

When started, GDevelop automatically search for new updates. You can see the progress by clicking on `About GDevelop` in the [start page](/gdevelop5/interface) or in the menu.

In the About window, you'l see if an update is being downloaded:

![](/gdevelop5/interface/update-being-downloaded.png)

When it's done, GDevelop will inform you that the update is ready:

![](/gdevelop5/interface/update-downloaded.png)

A notification can also be shown:

![](/gdevelop5/interface/update-notification-macos.png)

You can now close GDevelop and open it again: the new update will be installed. Check again the About window to see the version number updated.

## Got a problem? Download again GDevelop from the website

If the update can't be applied for any reason, or if you think that GDevelop is not working after an update, just [download again GDevelop from the website](https://gdevelop-app.com). Your preferences won't be lost.
