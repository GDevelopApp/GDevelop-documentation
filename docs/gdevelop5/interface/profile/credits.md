# GDevelop Credits

GDevelop Credits is an in-app currency that gives you access to premium features and services inside the GDevelop ecosystem. For now, they are mostly useful to buy Marketing and Promotion packages in the GDevelop ecosystem and will later allow to purchase assets, cloud builds and other online services.

Credits can be purchased and utilized on any platform, whether on the web, desktop, or mobile devices.
When credits are acquired, or won (by participating to a game jam, unlocking an achievement or other specific actions in the community), they are tied to your GDevelop account. Your account serves as a centralized hub for managing and tracking your credit balance.
