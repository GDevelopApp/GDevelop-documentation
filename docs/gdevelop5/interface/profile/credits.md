# GDevelop Credits

GDevelop Credits is an in-app currency that gives you access to premium features and services inside the GDevelop ecosystem. They can be used to get Marketing and Promotion packages in the GDevelop ecosystem, acquire assets or game templates as well as additional online builds.

Credits can be purchased and utilized on any platform, whether on the web, desktop, or mobile devices.
When credits are acquired, or won (by participating to a game jam, unlocking an achievement or other specific actions in the community), they are tied to your GDevelop account. Your account serves as a centralized hub for managing and tracking your credit balance.

## Using Credits in the GDevelop ecosystem

### Boosts (Marketing Packages)

Credits can be used to purchase a **Boost** for your game. These boosts will increase the visibility of your game on GDevelop's game platform, reaching a wider audience of dozens of thousands of players. According to the Boost, your game will also be promoted on GDevelop ad network.

You can learn more about the [Marketing and Boosts here](/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/marketing/).

### Assets and Game Templates

Credits can be used to purchase assets and game templates from the GDevelop store. These assets and templates can be used in your games, saving you time and effort in creating your own assets or game from scratch.
