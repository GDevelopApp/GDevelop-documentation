## Project editors

When editing a game with GDevelop, multiple editors can be opened in tabs next to the home page:

 1. Project manager
 2. Scene editor
 3. Events editor
 4. Preview
 5. Debugger

![Project-Workspace](Project-Workspace.png)

### 1. Project manager

Located in the upper-left corner, the **[Project manager](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager/#project-manager)** becomes active when a project is open. It provides access to:

 * [Global variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/global-variables/#global-variables)
 * [Resources](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager/resources)
 * [Scenes](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/)
 * [Extensions](/gdevelop5/extensions/tiers/#extension-tiers)
 * [External events](/gdevelop5/interface/events-editor/external-events/#external-events)
 * [External layouts](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/external-layouts/#external-layouts)

Use the project manager to add new elements to your project.

!!! note

    GDevelop doesn't close a project automatically. Even if all project tabs are closed, GDevelop still considers the project to be open and active.


To close a project, click the three-dot menu on the project's card and select "Close Project." Ensure all changes are saved beforehand.

### 2. Scene editor

The **Scene editor** is where you design and build game levels and menus by placing and configuring objects. The first scene in the list is loaded when the game starts.

Learn more about the scene editor [here](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor).

### 3. Events editor
The Events Editor allows you to define your game's logic using GDevelop's visual no-code system.

Learn more about [its usage on this page](/gdevelop5/interface/events-editor) or check [the help about events](/gdevelop5/events).

### 4. Preview
You can preview your project at any time using the **[Preview](/gdevelop5/interface/preview/#previewing-your-game)** button in the toolbar. Additional options are available in the drop-down menu next to the button.

### 5. Debugger
The **[debugger](/gdevelop5/interface/debugger/profile-your-game/)** allows you to inspect a running game, helps identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize resource usage.
