## Project tab

The Project tab provides tools for game creation, including:

 * Project manager
 * Scene editor
 * Events editor
 * Preview
 * Debugger

![Project-Workspace](Project-Workspace.png)

### 1. Project manager
Located in the upper-left corner, the **[Project manager](/gdevelop5/interface/project-manager/#project-manager)** activates when a project is open. It offers access to:

 * [Global variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/global-variables/#global-variables)
 * [Resources](/gdevelop5/tutorials/resources/#resources)
 * [Scenes](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/)
 * [Extensions](/gdevelop5/extensions/tiers/#extension-tiers)
 * [External events](/gdevelop5/interface/events-editor/external-events/#external-events)
 * [External layouts](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor/external-layouts/#external-layouts)

Use the project manager's drawer to add new elements to your project.

!!! note

    GDevelop doesn't close a project automatically. Even if all the project tabs are closed, GDevelop still considers the project to be open and active.

**Saving and quitting a project**

To close a project, click the three-dot menu on the project's card and select "Close Project". Ensure all changes are saved beforehand.

### 2. Scene editor

The **Scene editor** is where you design and build game levels and menus by placing and configuring objects. The first scene in the list is loaded when the game starts.

Learn more about the scene editor and it's parts [here](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor).

### 3. Events editor
The Events Editor allows you to define your game's logic using GDevelop's visual no-code system.

Learn more about [its usage on this page](/gdevelop5/interface/events-editor) or check [the help about events](/gdevelop5/events).

### 4. Preview
You can preview your project at any time using the **[Preview](/gdevelop5/interface/preview/#previewing-your-game)** button in the toolbar. Additional options are available in the drop-down menu next to the button.

### 5. Debugger
The **[debugger](/gdevelop5/interface/debugger/profile-your-game/)** helps identify performance bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.
