# Global Objects

Global objects are [objects](/gdevelop5/objects) which are globally accessible; that is, they are usable by all [Scenes](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor).

## Setting an object as global

An object may be made global by opening an object's menu in the [Scene Editor -> Objects](/gdevelop5/interface/scene-editor#objects_editor) panel and clicking **Set as a global object**.

    Once an object is made global, it **cannot be undone**. Please take the time to save a copy of your project before making an object global, in case you'd like to reverse the change.
