# Ask the AI: the AI helper

The **AI chat** is designed specifically to answer questions about game creation, help with brainstorming ideas and give GDevelop technical advice. It helps to discover extensions or features that you can use, and explain how to implement a new mechanic.

Unlike Chat GPT or Gemini, GDevelop's AI can see your project's information which improves its understanding of your requests.

## How to use it (good practices)

The "Ask" mode can be used as an idea generator, a "how do I" specialist, a GDevelop teacher or a project planner.
For better implementation results here are some tips:

- **Create a good prompt, be specific**
    Start describing what you want to create followed by how you'd like it to behave. Be as specific as possible with values, gravity, or how it needs to feel for the player.

- **Build incrementally**
    Add simple requests and questions at a time and take it from there. Keep adding information, knowledge or expectations that the AI could use to give you a better answer.

- **Plan before execution**
    Use the "Ask" mode to plan your desired implementation before switching to [Build mode](). This will consume less credits.

The AI will reply in a few seconds. Answers often include links to helpful resources, extensions, behaviors, and relevant GDevelop concepts like actions or conditions.

You can continue the conversation with the chat by asking follow-up questions. 

!!! note

    As all AIs in the market, answers might not be perfect. From time to time it can confuse some concepts, misunderstand your game or lack clarity on what you're trying to do.
    Always verify its answers, and use them as suggestions rather than truths. If you'd like to improve your game development knowledge and your use of GDevelop follow the **[GDevelop Essentials Course](https://gdevelop.io/academy)**.


## What the AI chat can do

The AI understands all built-in GDevelop features and official reviewed extensions. When active, it has access to your game's logic, game architecture and object configuration. It's knowledge is feed with:

- General wiki documentation,
- Extension and behavior documentation,
- Inspect your scenes and objects,
- Analyze objects' behaviors and other values,
- Read the events of a scene,
- Read global and scene elements

**What it cannot do**

The AI has **no access** to any personal details like your username, profile information, cloud projects, leaderboards, analytics or other personal detail from your user account. **None of the community's projects have been used to train the AI**.

Its technical limitations are the following:

- It cannot scrap your projects for AI training,
- Search the internet,
- Make changes to your project (for that check the [Build](/gdevelop5/interface/ai/agent/) function).


## Cost of AI questions

"Ask" mode questions require less credits than "[Build](/gdevelop5/interface/ai/agent/)" questions. Answers could be between 3 to 5 credits depending on the complexity of the answer and the number of ressources the AI has to "read" to give an answer.

!!! note
    If you've run out of free AI requests you can wait for them to reset every Sunday at 23:50 UTC, upgrade your [GDevelop Subscription](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=subscription) to get more AI requests, or [get more GDevelop credits](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=credits-purchase).

**Keeping an eye on credit usage**

The interface displays the number of AI requests left in the bottom right of the chat's input. Hover or tap the "question" button to see credit reset time.

Prioritizing the "Ask" mode over "Build" mode will save you credits by reducing implementation misunderstanding from the AI. Consider planning your implementations before executing them.

## How to improve the AI

You can rate the AI’s answers with a 👍 or 👎. Positive ratings will signal the AI to follow that rationale. Negative feedback will nudge the GDevelop team that the answer wasn't correct.

In the case of negative feedback, adding context to why the answer wasn't correct will help the engineers stir the AI to the right direction.

!!! note

   High AI demand can temporarily slow processing down or prevent the AI to give a proper response. In that case — don’t worry — you won’t be charged any credits.
