# Ask the AI: the AI helper

The **AI chat** is designed specifically to answer questions about game creation, help with brainstorming ideas and give GDevelop technical advice. The AI chat is perfect for getting a better understanding of a game develpment notion, discover extensions or features that you can use or learn how to build something.

Unlike Chat GPT or Gemini, GDevelop's AI has access to your project's information to gain knowledge and context.

## How to use it (good practices)

"Ask" AI mode can be used as an idea generator, a "how do I" specialist, a GDevelop teacher or a project planner.
For better implementation results here are some tips:

- Ask one simple question at a time and take it from there.
- Create a good prompt, be specific
- Use it to plan your desired implementation before switching to [Build mode](). This will consume less credits.
- One you've finished a desired implementation or want to change topics start a new chat. If you want to switch topics or ask something unrelated, click **"Start a new chat"** — this helps the AI better focus on your new request. (more on this in the build section)

The AI will reply in a few seconds. Answers often include **links to helpful resources, extensions, behaviors**, and relevant GDevelop concepts like actions or conditions.
You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. 

!!! note

    As with every AI tool, the AI answers are not perfect. From time to time, it can confuse some concepts, misunderstanding your game or what you're trying to do.
    Always double check the answers and use the AI answers as suggestions to build your game. It's a good idea to follow the **[GDevelop Essentials Course](https://gdevelop.io/academy)** to quickly learn the basics of GDevelop and make your first games.


## What the AI chat can do -- chat can help you with

The AI understands all built-in GDevelop features, and official reviewed extensions. It has the knowledge of your game and can explore it:

- It can inspect your scenes and objects,
- Analyze objects' behaviors and other values,
- Read the events of a scene,

**What it cannot do**

- Scrap your projects for AI training. None of the communitie's projects have been used to train the AI.
- Make changes to your project (for that check the Build function)

The AI has **no access** or details about your username, profile, cloud projects, leaderboards, analytics or any personal detail from your user account.


## Cost of AI questions

"Ask" mode questions require less credits than "Build" questions. Answers could be between 3 to 5 credits depending on the complexity of the answer and the number of ressources the AI has to "read" to give an answer.

Each GDevelop account starts with a few **free AI credits** every week. You can wait for them to reset every Sunday at 23:50 UTC, or [get more AI requests](gdevelop5/interface/ai/#aquiring-credits-for-ai-requests) through the app.

**Keeping an eye on credit usage**

The interface will make the number of AI requests visible in the bottom right of the chat's input.

If you hover/tap the text indicating the price of the request, below the field where you write your request, you will see the credits paid for the last request you sent.

## Help us improve the AI

You can rate the AI’s answers with a 👍 or 👎. These ratings help the GDevelop team improve the assistant.

!!! note

    Sometimes, high demand can temporarily slow things down or prevent a proper response. If that happens, don’t worry — you won’t be charged credits.
