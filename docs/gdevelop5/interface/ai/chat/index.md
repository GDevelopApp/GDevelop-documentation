# Ask the AI: the AI helper

The **AI chat** is a chat assistant designed specifically to answer questions about GDevelop and game creation.

## How to use it

To open the AI, click the "Ask AI" button in the top-right corner of the GDevelop interface. Select **"Ask a question"**, then type your question and send it — that’s it.

The AI will reply in a few seconds. Answers often include **links to helpful resources, extensions, behaviors**, and relevant GDevelop concepts like actions or conditions.

!!! note

    As with every AI tool, the AI answers are not perfect. From time to time, it can confuse some concepts, misunderstanding your game or what you're trying to do.
    Always double check the answers and use the AI answers as suggestions to build your game. It's a good idea to follow the **[GDevelop Essentials Course](https://gdevelop.io/academy)** to quickly learn the basics of GDevelop and make your first games.

You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. If you want to switch topics or ask something unrelated, click **"Start a new chat"** — this helps the AI better focus on your new request.

## What the AI chat can help you with

The AI understands all built-in GDevelop features and official, reviewed extensions (it doesn’t include community extensions unless they’ve been approved by the GDevelop team). It has the knowledge of your game and can explore it:

- It can inspect your scenes and objects,
- Read the events of a scene,
- And generally speaking, inspect any part of your game but it can't do any changes to it.

It has **no access** or details given about your username, profile, cloud projects, leaderboards, analytics or any personal detail from your user account.

The AI chat is perfect for getting a better understanding of a game develpment notion, discover extensions or features that you can use or learn how to build something.


## Cost of an answer from the AI

Each account starts with a few **free AI credits**. If you have a GDevelop Silver, Gold or Pro subscription, you’ll receive more every week: 200 with Silver, 1000 with Gold and 3000 with Pro.

A request to the AI chat you send uses **3 to 30 AI credits**. The actual price depends on how much thinking and research the AI agent has to do. A simple request for a small change or question can be 3 credits, while a request that needs to read multiple events or inspect behaviors of several objects could cost 10 credits.

!!! tip

    Once you've used all your AI credits, you can either wait for them to replenish (every Sunday at 23:50 UTC) or buy additional credits.
    [A package of 500 credits](/gdevelop5/interface/profile/credits) usually represents 100 to 120 requests to the AI chat. Remember you can get **free credits by following GDevelop accounts** on socials — check your profile!


If you hover/tap the text indicating the price of the request, below the field where you write your request, you will see the credits paid for the last request you sent.

## Help us improve the AI

You can rate the AI’s answers with a 👍 or 👎. These ratings help the GDevelop team improve the assistant.

!!! note

    Sometimes, high demand can temporarily slow things down or prevent a proper response. If that happens, don’t worry — you won’t be charged credits.
