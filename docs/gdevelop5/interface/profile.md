# My profile

The profile page allows you to manage your GDevelop account, and customize what others can see of you. This is also the place to pick or manage your subscription.
A GDevelop account is needed to profit of GDevelop services such as the one-click export of your game for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux and [gd.games](https://gd.games/).

You can see your account details or, if you don't have one, create a new one for free! in the File menu (on Windows and Linux) or in the GDevelop menu (on macOS), choose "My profile":

A profile can have some properties:
- **An username**. Your unique username on GDevelop's websites and services.
- **A biography**. Introduce yourself in a few words, tell us who you are and what you do.
- **A donation link**. Useful to bind your Patreon, Paypal, Ko-fi, or any URL.
- Is your subscription to the **GDevelop Newsletter** is active.
- Is your subscription to **the analytics of your games** is active.
- The current **GDevelop subscription** running on your account.

### Changing your profile picture

GDevelop does not host and control profile pictures. Instead, it obtains your profile picture from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com). If you have or create a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) account, you can link a new profile picture to the email address you used to register your GDevelop account. This will change automatically your profile picture in GDevelop as well.

## Subscription

### Get a subscription

By default, accounts are free. There are no limits on the games that you create with GDevelop.
A few online services are limited. Limited services rely on servers that can be costly. In particular, with a free account, you can create 2 [packages for Android](/gdevelop5/publishing/android_and_ios) each day.

By getting a subscription, you can unlock more than 2 packages a day. In the future, there will be more one-click packaging and useful services. Some of these services are in Beta testing now.  Your subscription also supports the future development of GDevelop. ✨
