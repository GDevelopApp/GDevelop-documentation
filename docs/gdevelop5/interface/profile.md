# My profile

The profile page allows you to manage your GDevelop account, and customize what others see on your profile. This is also the place to manage your subscription.
A GDevelop account is needed to use GDevelop services such as the one-click export of your game for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and [gd.games](https://gd.games/).

You can see your account details or, if you don't have one, create a new one for free.

## Create an account

 1. Start by going to the **Home** screen.
 2. In the top-right corner click on **Create account**.

 4. Then click **Create account**.
 5. To confirm your account creation, you will receive an email with a link to click on.

Once you're logged into your account, you can see your profile. You can then use GDevelop's online services, like packaging your game in a single click!


### Customize your profile

You can customize your public profile information directly from the GDevelop interface to share more about yourself as a game creator. The details filled will all be displayed on GDevelop's game hosting platform [gd.games](https://gd.games/) and on your GDevelop user page that appears if someone clicks on your name on one of your contributions such as extensions, examples, and assets.

Profiles have different properties:

- **An username**. Your unique username on GDevelop's websites and services.
- **A biography**. Introduce yourself in a few words, tell us who you are and what you do.
- **A donation link**. Useful for linking your Patreon, Paypal, Ko-fi, or any URL.
- If your subscription to the **GDevelop Newsletter** is active.
- If your subscription to **the analytics of your games** is active.
- The current **GDevelop subscription** running on your account.

### Changing your profile picture

GDevelop does not host or control profile pictures. Instead, it obtains your profile picture from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com). If you have or create a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) account, you can link a new profile picture to the email address you used to register your GDevelop account. This will automatically change your profile picture in GDevelop as well.

## Subscription

### Get a subscription

With the free plan, the online services are limited. These services rely on servers which can be costly.
If you find yourself needing more exports each day or a higher number of leaderboards, or if you want to customize the leaderboards in your games you may want to upgrade your free plan to a better one.

See the [pricing page](https://gdevelop.io/pricing) to know more about the advantages of the Silver, Gold, School, and Business subscriptions compared to the free plan.

!!! note
		
		If you want, you can later subscribe again to another subscription. In any case, you won't lose any of your games or work!


### Redeem a code

!!! warning

    Please only redeem one subscription at a time, as redeeming multiple subscriptions at once will cancel the previous subscription.
    We recommend you wait for the present subscription to end before activating another.

If you don’t have a GDevelop account yet, create one (you just need an email address, a username, and a password).

Once your account is created, open your profile, click on **Manage subscription** then on **Redeem a code** .
If you’re lost, click on the link below to open your subscription panel in your browser:

[https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=subscription](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=subscription)
