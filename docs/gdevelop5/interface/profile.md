You can see your account details or, if you don't have one, create a new one for free! in the File menu (on Windows and Linux) or in the GDevelop menu (on macOS), choose "My profile":

Once you're logged into your account, you can see your profile. You can then use GDevelop specific services. Services like packaging your game for Android with one click!

## Get a subscription

By default, accounts are free. There are no limits on the games that you create with GDevelop.
A few online services are limited. Limited services rely on servers that can be costly. In particular, with a free account, you can create 2 [packages for Android](/gdevelop5/publishing/android_and_ios) each day.

By getting a subscription, you can unlock more than 2 packages a day. In the future, there will be more one-click packaging and useful services. Some of these services are in Beta testing now.  Your subscription also supports the future development of GDevelop. âœ¨

        7 euros is approximately $7.5. 2 euros is approximately $2.20 (use a Currency Calculator to find the most current amount in USA dollars or your local currency.)

The next payment will automatically be adapted to your new subscription!

### Changing your profile picture

GDevelop does not host and control profile pictures. Instead, it obtains your profile picture from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com). If you have or create a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) account, you can link a new profile picture to the email address you used to register your GDevelop account. This will change automatically your profile picture in GDevelop as well.
