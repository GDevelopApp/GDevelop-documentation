# My profile

The profile page allows you to manage your GDevelop account, and customize what others can see of you. This is also the place to manage your subscription.
A GDevelop account is needed to profit of GDevelop services such as the one-click export of your game for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux and [gd.games](https://gd.games/).

You can see your account details or, if you don't have one, create a new one for free.

In the window, you can see your profile (or create one if you don't have an account) and also see the last usages you've done of the online services.

## Create an account

If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.


 1. Start by going to the **home** screen.
 2. In the top-right corner click on **Create account**.

Once you're logged into your account, you can see your profile. You can then use GDevelop specific services. Services like packaging your game for multiple support in one click!


### Customize your profile

You can customise your public profile information directly from the GDevelop interface to tell more about you as a game creator. The details filled will all be displayed on [gd.games](https://gd.games/) the GDevelop's gaming platform and on your GDevelop user page that appears if someone clicks on your name on one of your contribution such as extensions, examples, and assets.

A profile can have some properties:

- **An username**. Your unique username on GDevelop's websites and services.
- **A biography**. Introduce yourself in a few words, tell us who you are and what you do.
- **A donation link**. Useful to bind your Patreon, Paypal, Ko-fi, or any URL.
- Is your subscription to the **GDevelop Newsletter** is active.
- Is your subscription to **the analytics of your games** is active.
- The current **GDevelop subscription** running on your account.

### Changing your profile picture

GDevelop does not host and control profile pictures. Instead, it obtains your profile picture from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com). If you have or create a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) account, you can link a new profile picture to the email address you used to register your GDevelop account. This will change automatically your profile picture in GDevelop as well.

## Subscription

### Get a subscription

With the free plan a few online services are limited. Limited services rely on servers that can be costly.
If your uses of GDevelop start require more exports each day or a higher number of leaderboards, or you may want to customise the leaderboards of your games you may want to upgrade your free plan to a bigger one.

See the [pricing page](https://gdevelop.io/pricing) to know more about the advantages of the Silver and Gold subscriptions compared to the free plan.
