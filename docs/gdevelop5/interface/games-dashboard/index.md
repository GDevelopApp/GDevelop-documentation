# Manage Games


!!! note

    **Who can use this feature:** All users with a GDevelop account who had published their game to [gd.games](https://gd.games)

Tracking game performance post-launch is crucial. It helps identify improvements, understand player behavior, and enhance the gaming experience for long-term success. Once the project has been publised, it's important to set up a system to collect player feedback, encourage player competition, market the game and measure player's engagement and retention.

GDevelop's Manage section is equipped with features such as leaderboards, player feedback, game lobbies, and marketing publication packages. They provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developers to enhance player engagement and drive the success of their games.

* Game Details (game information)
* Build Management
* [Player Feedback](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/player-feedback/)
* [Game Analytics](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/game-analytics)
* [Game Leaderboards](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/leaderboard-administration/)
* [Game Marketing and Ads](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/marketing/)

All these services are available for all users with a GDevelop account, and are easy to configurate and work **without** intrusive trackers, third party applications or compromising your players privacy.

!!! tip

    Depending on the terms and conditions under which your game is distributed, you may want to inform and give a way to your players to not send any data. This can be done using an action to enable or disable the metrics.

## Publishing the game

To enable the "Manage" functionality and access the game's metrics, the project has to be published on [gd.games](https://gd.games). Before publishing your game, make sure to be logged to the [GDevelop account](/gdevelop5/interface/profile) that you wish to use to publish.

Numerous platforms are available for export. Learn how to do it according to your desired platforms with the help of [this guide](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/publishing/).

Once your game is online, the game will be automatically visible and available through the app's "Manage" section.

!!! note

    Game insights are collected anonymously when a game is launched. It's important to respect the privacy of the players, so GDevelop does not collect nor store any personal information. This means that while aggregated data can be useful to understand your audience, you can't know about a particular player, because the information is not stored and players are not tracked individually.


## Manage Games Dashboard

Through the dashboard view, a creator can configure their game's visibility on GDevelop's free publishing website [gd.games](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/publishing/web/#creating-a-private-web-link):

* **Make discoverable on gd.games:** Players will be available to find the game through the gd.games website
* **Show feedback banner on gd.page:** The game will display a banner to collect [player feedback](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/player-feedback/) through gd.games website
* **Ask for feedback on all builds:** All published versions of the game listed under the "Builds" tab will dislay the feedback banner to collect player feedback

To learn how to publish to the gd.games platform and configure the privacy of the links follow [these instructions](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/publishing/web/).

## About collecting metrics

While GDevelop strives to collect only usage metrics that are anonymized and limits these to the purpose of Game Research to analize the performance of your game, you may collect other metrics by your own means. In any case, you must have a clear privacy policy (which will be asked by most app stores) explaining how you use these data to respect the privacy of your users.

!!! tip

    - If you want to **display an explanation** before enabling metrics collection, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game, then use the action to enable them again once the player consent to the metrics collection.
    
    - If you **don't want to collect any metrics at all**, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game. By doing this, no data will be sent at all. Be aware that you won't be able to follow the number of sessions played on your game.
