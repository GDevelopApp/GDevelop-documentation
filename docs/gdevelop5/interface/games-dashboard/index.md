# Manage Games


!!! note

    **Who can use this feature**
    * Users with a free account
    * Users with a Silver, Gold, Pro and Education account
    * Users publishing to gd.games (some services like Analytics and Player feedback are not available outside gd.games)


Creating interactive content with GDevelop is only the first step of making a successful game. Once the project has been publised, it's important to set up a system to collect player feedback, encourage player competition, market the game and measure player's engagement and retention.

GDevelop's Manage Game section responds to these needs with:
* Game Details (game information)
* Build Management
* Player Feedback
* Game Analytics
* [Game Leaderboards](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/leaderboard-administration/)
* [Game Marketing and Ads](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/marketing/)

All these services are available for all users with a GDevelop account, and are easy to configurate and work **without** intrusive trackers, third party applications or compromising your players privacy.

!!! tip

    Depending on the terms and conditions under which your game is distributed, you may want to inform and give a way to your players to not send any data. This can be done using an action to enable or disable the metrics.

## Publishing the game

The "Manage Game" functionalites are only available for published projects. The game can be public or private, but it has to be available online. To enable the "Manage Game", make sure to have a GDevelop [account](/gdevelop5/interface/profile). It is completley free.

After [publishing your game to gd.games]([https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/publishing/#publish-and-share-on-gdgames](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/publishing/)),

## View the metrics of your game

When you've opened the "Manage Game" section, navigate to the Analytics tab. This shows various numbers that are useful to understand how successful is your game.

You'll find:

- the number of **sessions** (number of time the game was launched),
- the number of **players** for the selected day, and the number of new players (that never launched the game before - unless they have uninstalled the game),
- how many players are playing again for for up to 7 days after the first time they played (this is what is called the "**retention**").

If you don't have a GDevelop subscription, you'll only get access to the number of sessions - which should still give you an overview of your game success. As GDevelop is providing the analytics, the infrastructure cost and the bandwidth to collect the session metrics, we ask you to support GDevelop by getting a subscription. This will help the development of the game engine for the future and help to strengthen the community!

!!! note

    These data are collected anonymously when a game is launched. It's important to respect the privacy of the players, and no personal information is ever collected or stored. This means that while *aggregated* data can be useful to understand your audience, you can't know about a particular player, because the information is not stored and players are not tracked individually.

While the presentation of the metrics is for now very simple, it will be improved later to offer a better picture of the sessions played on your game.

## About collecting metrics

While GDevelop strive to collect only usage metrics that are anonymized, and limits these to the purpose of analyzing the performance of your game, you may collect other metrics by your own means. In any cases, it's important that you have a clear privacy policy (which will be asked by most app stores anyway) explaining how you use these data and respect the privacy of your users.

!!! tip

    If you want to **display an explanation** before enabling metrics collection, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game, *then use the action to enable them again* once the player consent to the metrics collection.

!!! tip

    If you don't want to **collect any metrics at all**, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game. By doing this, no data will be sent at all. Of course, this means that you won't be able to follow the number of sessions played on your game.

## Manage leaderboards for your games

By clicking on the tab Leaderboards, you can access the [Leaderboard Administration](/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/leaderboard-administration) interface.

## Getting a Marketing Campaign

You can access the [Marketing Campaigns](/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/marketing) interface by clicking on the tab Marketing & Ads.
