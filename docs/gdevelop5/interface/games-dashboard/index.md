# Manage Tab

!!! note

    **Who can use this feature:** All users with a GDevelop account who had [published their game to gd.games](/gdevelop5/publishing).

GDevelop's game insights offers various metrics **without** intrusive trackers, third-party applications, or compromising players' privacy.

!!! tip

    Depending on the terms and conditions under which your game is distributed, you may want to inform and give a way to your players to not send any data. This can be done using an action to enable or disable the metrics.

## Registering a game

To access the game's metrics, the project has to be [published on gd.games](/gdevelop5/publishing/web/). Before publishing your game, make sure to be logged to the [GDevelop account](/gdevelop5/interface/profile) that you wish to publish.

Once the game has been shared, the Manage section will be habilitated and accessible through the App.

To access game analytics, click the "Manage game" button to access more functionalities.

!!! note

    Game insights are collected anonymously when a game is launched. It's important to respect the privacy of the players, so GDevelop does not collect nor store any personal information. This means that while *aggregated* data can be useful to understand your audience, you can't know about a particular player, because the information is not stored and players are not tracked individually.

## Available data

Once the game has been published to gd.games, GDevelop will make the following insights available:

* [Player feedback](gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/player-feedback/): collect written feedback from players
* [Analytics](gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/game-analytics/): follow player engagement and retention
* [Leaderboards](gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/leaderboard-administration/): leverage gamification strategies
* [Marketing and Ads](gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/marketing/): promote your games to improve visibility

GDevelop is providing the analytics, the infrastructure cost, and bandwidth to collect the session metrics.
Some insights inside the Manage Tab might be limited according to your GDevelop Subscription plan. [Click here](https://gdevelop.io/pricing) to learn more on Analytics availablity according to Subscriptions.


## About collecting metrics

While GDevelop strives to collect only usage metrics that are anonymized and limits these to the purpose of Game Research to analize the performance of your game, you may collect other metrics by your own means. In any case, you must have a clear privacy policy (which will be asked by most app stores) explaining how you use these data to respect the privacy of your users.

!!! tip

    If you want to **display an explanation** before enabling metrics collection, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game, *then use the action to enable them again* once the player consent to the metrics collection.

!!! tip

    If you don't want to **collect any metrics at all**, use the action to disable the metrics collection at the beginning of your game. By doing this, no data will be sent at all. Be aware that you won't be able to follow the number of sessions played on your game.
