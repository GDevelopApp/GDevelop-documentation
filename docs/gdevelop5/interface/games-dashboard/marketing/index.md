# GDevelop Marketing Campaigns

GDevelop Marketing Campaigns are packages designed to improve the visibility of your game within the GDevelop community and beyond. Whether you're gearing up for a game launch, seeking valuable feedback, or simply looking to increase your game's exposure, these packages offer tailored solutions to meet your promotional needs.

## Why Use a Marketing Campaign?

Marketing Campaigns are particularly beneficial during crucial phases of game development, such as:

- Pre-Launch: Build anticipation and gather feedback before your game is officially published.
- Wishlist Building: Encourage users to add your game to their wishlists (notably on Steam), boosting its potential success upon release.
- Visibility Enhancement: Increase your game's overall visibility and attract a broader audience.

## How to Get a Marketing Campaign?

Marketing Campaigns can be purchased inside GDevelop, using GDevelop Credits.

1. Head down to your Games Dashboard
2. Pick the game you want to promote
3. Click on the "Marketing & Ads" tab to explore the available packages.
