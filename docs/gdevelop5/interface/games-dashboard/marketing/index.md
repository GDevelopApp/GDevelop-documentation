# GDevelop Marketing Campaigns

GDevelop Marketing Campaigns are packages designed to improve the visibility of your game within the GDevelop community and beyond. Whether you're gearing up for a game launch, seeking valuable feedback, or simply looking to increase your game's exposure, these packages offer tailored solutions to meet your promotional needs.

## Why Use a Marketing Campaign?

Marketing Campaigns are particularly beneficial during crucial phases of game development, such as:

- Pre-Launch: Build anticipation and gather feedback before your game is officially published.
- Wishlist Building: Encourage users to add your game to their wishlists (notably on Steam), boosting its potential success upon release.
- Visibility Enhancement: Increase your game's overall visibility and attract a broader audience.

Marketing Campaigns can be purchased inside GDevelop, using GDevelop Credits.
