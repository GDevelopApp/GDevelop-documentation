# Boosts (GDevelop Marketing Campaigns)

GDevelop Marketing Campaigns, also called **Boosts**, are packages designed to improve the visibility of your game within the GDevelop community and beyond. Whether you're gearing up for a game launch, seeking valuable feedback, or simply looking to increase your game's exposure, these packages offer tailored solutions to meet your promotional needs.

## Why Use a Boost?

Boosts are beneficial during different phases of game development. For example:

- Pre-Launch: Build anticipation and gather feedback before your game is officially published.
- Wishlist Building: Encourage users to add your game to their wishlists (notably on Steam), boosting its potential success upon release.
- Visibility Enhancement: Increase your game's overall visibility and attract a broader audience.
- Retention: Acquiring players and check if they come back to continue playing the game. 

### How Boosts Work

When you boost your game, depending on the Boost you selected, your game will:

* Appear as a highlighted, **promoted game on gd.games**, making it more visible to players browsing the platform and other game creators on the GDevelop "Play" tab.
* Be featured in ads run by GDevelop on platforms like **TikTok and other social media channels**.

The ads GDevelop runs are designed to attract new players, many of whom may not know about GDevelop or your game. These ads are usually generic gaming ads that promote games in general.

Since these players likely have no prior knowledge of your game, it's crucial to make **a strong first impression** - see the next sections to learn more about the audience and advices for your game.

### Understanding the Audience of a Boost

GDevelop’s ads target a broad audience, making player acquisition very cost-effective. They are appealing to gamers in general and will often be short videos showcasing multiple games of various genres.
Thanks to this broad targeting, the cost to acquire players is multiple times lower than what is usually seen when ads are run for a single game.

However, if you want more control over targeting, you can run your own ads on other networks. This comes with higher costs but may better align with your game’s niche audience.

While demographics can vary, the typical audience for a Boost is:

* Age: **18–55**
* Gender: 60% male / 40% female
* Region: **Europe and the Middle East**
* Device: Majority on mobile, so ensure your game is **touchscreen-friendly**.

## Best Practices for a Successful Boost

To ensure your game performs well during a Boost, focus on these key areas:

### 1. Optimize Loading and Presentation

* **Fast loading times:** A smooth loading experience helps reduce player drop-off.
* **Attractive and simple first screen:** Whether it’s a title screen, menu, or first level, make sure it’s visually engaging and easy to understand.

!!! tip 
    
    Sessions are counted a few seconds after the loading screen finishes. This means the “bounce rate” (players leaving without playing) can be tracked accurately, without being impacted by people immediately leaving the page. Ensure your game hooks players immediately!

### 2. Focus on Fun and Accessibility

Highly engaging games often:

* Allow players to **start playing immediately** without needing a tutorial or complex menus.
* Offer a **polished gameplay experience** that retains players from the first interaction.
* Use menus or title screens strategically, such as after the first level or in subsequent playthroughs.

!!! tip 
    
    Use variables and Storage actions in GDevelop to remember returning players and tailor their experience.
