Player feedback is a crucial step in the process of game development.

It helps developers understand player interactions, preferences, and areas needing improvement to increase game adoption by their final target market for game success.

GDevelop's integrated player feedback allows developers to enhance game design to increase player satisfaction, leading to a more engaging experience and a loyal player base.

## Feedback availabity by channel
Player Feedback is available to every user with a GDevelop account from free to paying subscriptions and only through [gd.games](https://gd.games/).

Games published on sites like Itch, Newgrounds, Poki, and personal websites; or exported to Android or iOS cannot collect player feedback.

Games published on gd.games can be:

* Public and visible to the gd.games community (recommended for public player feedback)
* Unlisted on gd.games only available to people with the URL
* Uploaded to the gd.games server, but not available through the public website (recommended for private player feedback)


## Habilitating Player Feedback
Player feedback can be turned on or off acording to the game's development stage.

To be able to collect player feedback the game has to be available online. You can verify that the Game has been published to gd.games through the [Manage section](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/):

In the Game Manage screen, you can configure:

* **Visible on gd.games (yes/no):** Players will be able to find the game through the gd.games website
* **Revenue share (on/off):** gd.games will display ad banners in your game's page to start making revenue. You can see and manage your earnings through the Manage section.
* **Player feedback (on/off):** All published versions of the game listed under the "Builds" section will display the feedback banner to collect player feedback

### FAQ

2. **What happens after you report a spam review?** -> If a user gets flagged after a certain number of times, their profile will be blocked and they'll no longer be able to give feedback.
