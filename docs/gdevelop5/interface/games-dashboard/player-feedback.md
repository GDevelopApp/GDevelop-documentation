Player feedback is a crucial step in the process of game development.

It helps developers understand player interactions, preferences, and areas needing improvement in order to encrease game adoption by their final target market for game success.

GDevelop's intergrated player feedback allows developers to enhance game design to increase player satisfaction, leading to a more engaging experience and a loyal player base.

## Feedback availabity by channel
Player Feedack is available to every user with a GDevelop account from free to paying subscriptions and *only* through gd.games.
Games published on sites like Itch, Newgrounds, Poki, and personal website; or exported to Android or iOS cannot collect player feedback.

Games published on gd.games have the possibility to be:
* Public and visible to the gd.games community (recomended for public player feedback)
* Unlisted on gd.games only available to people with the URL
* Uploaded to the gd.games server, but not available through the public site (recommended for private player feedback)


## Habilitating Player Feedback
Player feedback can be turned on or off acording to the game's development stage.

To be able to collect player feedback the game has to be available online. You can verify that the Game has been published to gd.games through the [Manage section](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/interface/games-dashboard/):

* **Show feedback banner on gd.page:** the game will display a banner to collect player feedback through the site gd.games
* **Ask for feedback on all builds:** All published versions of the game listed under the "Builds" tab will dislay the feedback banner to collect player feedback
