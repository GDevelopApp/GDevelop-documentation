# GDevelop for Education - Teacher Guide

Welcome to GDevelop for Education! This guide will help you navigate the curriculum and make the most of the resources available to support your teaching.

## How to Use the Curriculum

### Understanding the Lesson Structure

#### Teacher-Facing Lessons

The lessons found under the **"Teach" tab are designed exclusively for teachers** and are not meant to be distributed to students. This approach was developed based on extensive feedback from educators who used GDevelop in their classrooms during the research and development process for GDevelop for Education.

**Why this matters:** The step-by-step instructions in these lessons ensure that no teacher ever gets lost when delivering the practical lesson. Every single click and every single drag is specified in detail, providing complete guidance even for educators who are new to game development.

#### Video Resources

If you prefer to use videos as teaching aids, the **[GDevelop YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GDevelopApp)** offers a fantastic resource with hours of free content covering various topics and techniques.

### Lesson Types

The GDevelop for Education curriculum includes several types of lessons, each serving a specific purpose in your students' learning journey.

#### Theory Lessons

The theory lessons are **introductory and concept-based**, providing a solid foundation for students who are newcomers to game-making and programming. These lessons cover fundamental concepts and terminology that will support students throughout their learning journey.

#### Practical Lessons

The practical lessons are **project-based**, with each lesson teaching students how to make a complete game from start to finish. These lessons are designed to be taught progressively for the following reasons:

- Each project teaches a different gameplay mechanic
- Each successive project increases in difficulty and complexity
- Students build upon skills learned in previous lessons
- The sequential structure ensures proper skill development

**Important:** Teachers should follow the practical lessons in order to ensure students have the prerequisite knowledge and skills for each new project.

### The Capstone Project: Game Jam

The curriculum culminates in an exciting capstone project format that brings together all the skills your students have learned.

#### What is a Game Jam?

The curriculum concludes with a **game jam** as the capstone project. A game jam is a creative event where participants design and develop a game within a set timeframe, typically working around a specific theme or constraint.

**Educational advantages of game jams:**

- **Creative problem-solving:** Students must think creatively within constraints, mirroring real-world development scenarios
- **Time management:** Working within deadlines teaches students to scope projects appropriately and prioritize features
- **Application of skills:** Students synthesize everything they've learned throughout the course into an original creation
- **Portfolio building:** The game jam produces a unique project students can showcase
- **Collaboration opportunities:** If done in teams, students develop communication and teamwork skills
- **Low-pressure experimentation:** The time-limited format encourages risk-taking and innovation without the pressure of perfection

**Why we chose a game jam:** This format provides an authentic, industry-relevant experience that empowers students to become creators rather than just followers of tutorials. It's an excellent assessment of their understanding and ability to apply concepts independently.

### GDevelop Master Course

In addition to the core curriculum, GDevelop for Education includes a comprehensive self-guided learning resource.

#### What is the Master Course?

The **self-guided GDevelop Master Course** contains 15 chapters of concept-based lessons. Teachers are encouraged to use this flexible resource in two key ways:

1. **As a complement to teacher-led lessons:** Integrate specific chapters here and there to reinforce or expand upon concepts covered in the practical lessons
2. **For differentiated instruction:** Use the Master Course to keep students engaged when they are not in sync with the main cohort:
   - **Students ahead of the cohort** can work through Master Course chapters to deepen their knowledge and stay challenged
   - **Students behind the cohort** can use relevant chapters to catch up on foundational concepts at their own pace

This approach allows you to maintain classroom momentum while addressing individual learning needs.
